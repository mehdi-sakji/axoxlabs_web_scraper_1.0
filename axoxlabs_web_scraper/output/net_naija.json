The former England and Liverpool captain's dismissal came 11 months after succeeding Dean Smith at Villa Park. He was relentlessly targeted by the Villa fans in attendance at Craven Cottage during the latter stages of the match against Fulham, which saw his side remain one place outside the Premier League's drop zone after picking up just nine points from 11 matches. Reports of 42-year-old Steven Gerrard being sacked were confirmed shortly after the full-time whistle in a short statement released by Aston Villa, who will now begin their search for a new permanent manager in due course. A club spokesperson is quoted as saying: \"We would like to thank Steven for his hard work and commitment and wish him well for the future.\" Villa has targeted former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, with conversations thought to have been held between intermediaries. Gerrard is the fourth Premier League manager to have been relieved of his duties since the beginning of the campaign after Scott Parker, Thomas Tuchel, and Bruno Lage. He replaced Dean Smith at Villa Park in November of last year and leaves the club after an 11-month reign, during which he guided them to a 14th-placed finish at the end of last season. Villa's next game is at home to Brentford on Sunday and at this stage, it is unclear who will take charge, though Villa may choose to turn to former player Gary McAllister, who was part of Gerrard's coaching staff.", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103585-steven-gerrard-sacked-aston-villa-11-months-charge"},

{"headline": "Kepa Arrizabalaga's incredible stats since replacing Edouard Mendy as Chelsea goalkeeper", "image_url": "https://static.netnaija.com/i/1qdNVjkoN4g.jpg", "author": "Same Emmanuel", "posted_date": "Oct 19", "description": "Kepa Arrizabalaga is shaping up to be the biggest redemption story of the season with the goalkeeper seemingly living up to his price tag... finally! The Spaniard became a world record signing when Chelsea paid \u00a371.6million to prise him away from Athletic Bilbao in 2018. It has been a topsy-turvy time for Kepa in the Blues goal and has often been a source of frustration for fans. He memorably refused to be substituted in the 2019 League Cup final when Maurizio Sarri wanted to bring on Willy Caballero for the penalty shoot out, which they then lost. The 28-year-old was even benched for the veteran goalkeeper under Frank Lampard before Edouard Mendy was signed. Mendy brought in in September 2020 and has been the unquestionable No.1, helping them win the Champions League in his first season. Kepa has played 36 times since the start of the 2020/21 season, while Mendy has played 99 times. Chelsea were more than willing to cut their losses on the Spaniard and it looked as though he would leave in the summer, however nothing materialised. Played - 6 Minutes - 540 Goals conceded per 90 - 1.5 Clean sheets - 1 Saves per 90 - 3 Save percentage - 66.7 per cent Goals conceded - 9 Expected goals conceded - 8.7 Goals prevented - -0.3 Passes per 90 - 22 Pass accuracy - 78 per cent Played - 3 Minutes - 270 Goals conceded per 90 - 0.3 Clean sheets - 2 Saves per 90 - 3.7 Save percentage - 91.7 per cent Goals conceded - 1 Expected goals conceded - 4.2 Goals prevented - 3.2 Passes per 90 - 28.7 Pass accuracy - 82.6 per cent \n\"He tried and checked his options, which we were aware of,\" said then Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel. \"They were not satisfying for him or for us so he stayed.\" This season it has all changed for Kepa, though, with Mendy making a catalogue of mistakes that cost him his place. Now new manager Graham Potter has made the Spaniard his trusty No.1 and has been brilliant in the last three Premier League games. In those three games, he has only conceded one goal and has made an average of 3.7 saves per game, with a save percentage of 91.7. Opta Stats show he has prevented 3.2 goals, more than any other goalkeeper even though he has played fewer games. Mendy conceded nine goals in six games, only saved 66.7 per cent of the shots he faced, and his goals prevented statistic was -0.3. Against Aston Villa, Kepa made an incredible seven saves while keeping a clean sheet and received huge praise. Potter said: \"Really pleased for him because we needed him today. Aston Villa made us suffer in the second period of the first half especially. \"Some fantastic saves, of course that's what he's there for, but we needed him.\" The Spaniard himself admitted confidence was high and he was now enjoying his time at Chelsea. He said: \"I'm feeling very well, with confidence, with and without the ball. Self-confidence and belief in your work, in what you're doing, and belief in the process is very important. \"Of course, I had really tough moments. I had really good moments, but in the end, it's like life. You have ups and downs, and you have to be strong mentally, stick with your ideas and keep working. Now I am enjoying all the work.\" Kepa has not been the most popular of Chelsea players in recent seasons, but he is more than earning back their support and respect. Former Charlton and Tottenham striker Darren Bent gave him huge credit for his turnaround. Bent told talkSPORT: \"He's had a run of games in the team. I think it's seven on the bounce now where he's played 90 minutes. \"He first played against Zagreb, then Mendy got injured and he got his opportunity and been playing really well. \"It's about him getting up to speed. Fair play to him because he's had a lot to deal with since being at Chelsea. The price tag and then whole situation in the Carabao Cup final where he wouldn't come off.\"", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103507-kepa-arrizabalagas-incredible-stats-replacing-edouard-mendy-chelsea"},

He also said the government is executing 83 road rehabilitation projects in federal tertiary institutions across the country with 66 projects completed and 46 commissioned.

Fashola in a previous chat with journalists had said the bridge would be ready for use before December. \"Our priority is to open the second Niger bridge to traffic by December so that those travelling for the season will do so at ease.

United took another step forward under Erik ten Hag on Wednesday evening as they delivered an excellent performance in their 2-0 win over Tottenham at Old Trafford. Fernandes, who scored a brilliant effort to double United's lead in the second half, was named man of the match for his display against Antonio Conte's side. Ronaldo, meanwhile, was left as an unused substitute by Erik ten Hag and opted to leave the dugout to walk back to the dressing room before the game had even finished. And Shearer believes Fernandes looks a better player without Ronaldo in the same side. 'Would I be stirring things if I said Bruno looks a lot happier in this team without Ronaldo?' Shearer said during commentary for Amazon Prime Sport. 'I just look at his performance tonight and look at his energy and look at his leadership qualities and look at what he's done both defensively and offensively. 'He has done so much for them in this performance tonight. He deserved that goal.' Meanwhile, Ten Hag has vowed to 'deal' with Ronaldo's conduct on Thursday. 'Yeah, I don't pay attention to that, we deal with that tomorrow,' said the United manager.

Ronaldo stormed off down the tunnel in a strop as he failed to come on from the bench as United beat Tottenham 2-0 on Wednesday night, with Dutch boss Ten Hag admitting after the victory that he will 'deal with' the player on Thursday. The 37-year-old, widely linked with an exit from Old Trafford in the summer, has been limited to 340 minutes of action across his opening eight Premier League games this term and was also an unused substitute against Manchester City. Former United defender Ferdinand, quizzed about the Portugal international's lack of playing time, told his YouTube channel: 'My only thought could be is that Cristiano Ronaldo is being saved for the weekend against Chelsea. 'That's the only way that I see it, logically, that he did not play [last night]. I think Ronaldo will be absolutely fuming with that, naturally. 'I wouldn't expect anything different from him. I think the big problem Erik ten Hag has got is that, coming up to this next window, he has to think very carefully about what he does. 'If he doesn't see Ronaldo as a starter in his team more often than not, I think he has to release him from his contract. \"I will deal with that tomorrow\" Erik ten Hag gives his reaction to Cristiano Ronaldo walking down the tunnel before the end of  ...   'He has to let him go. It's not fair on anybody, on the club, on Ronaldo, on Ten Hag, that the first question after every game is 'Why didn't Ronaldo start?' 'That will be a story. United won 2-0 and the leading story will be about Ronaldo. That can't be right. 'You sit here and think why did Man Utd not just let him go if Ten Hag knew he didn't want Ronaldo in his plans. That's the baffling thing for me. 'You think what he's done in his career... at his level... surely the manager would have known before the season started if he was going to play Ronaldo or not, if he wanted him in his team, if he was someone to build around. 'It looks to me right now that it was a no [he didn't want Ronaldo]. If that's the case, he should have let Ronaldo go. 'It's gong to be something that hampers Ten Hag going forward until the day Ronaldo leaves the club, because of how much of an icon and superstar he is.'", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103538-rio-ferdinand-warns-erik-ten-hag-cristiano-ronaldo-latest-strop-win"},

Since breaking into the Blues' first-team in 2019, Mount has been a regular for his club and country, helping Chelsea to the Champions League trophy and England to the Euros final last year. After a slow start to this season, the attacking midfield has rediscovered his best form since Potter's arrival at Stamford Bridge, scoring twice and making five assists in the new manager's first six games. He is sure to be included in the Three Lions' squad for the 2022 World Cup next month, and is likely to start for Gareth Southgate's team. Despite his obvious quality, many fans have often called for Southgate to drop Mount in favour of another one of England's star attackers such as Arsenal's Bukayo Saka or Manchester City duo Phil Foden and Jack Grealish. Potter cannot comprehend this line of thinking however and was keen to share his delight at the 23-year-old's attitude both on and off the pitch. 'It's a joy - he's a fantastic person,' Potter said in his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea's clash at Brentford on Wednesday night. 'He loves to play football and loves the club. Great attitude, he understands spaces, he can execute assists and score goals. He's top. 'It's surprising that I get questions on mixed opinion about Mason. I find that strange, especially from the outside and then when you work with him you see he's got everything you need to be a top, top player.' Potter also took time to praise Kepa Arrizabalaga, another player who has been in fine form since Potter's appointment at the Bridge. The goalkeeper put in a fantastic display in the 2-0 win at Aston Villa last Sunday, with his manager adding: 'Kepa's form is really pleasing for everybody, especially for him. 'I've been really impressed with his character and personality, he's very professional, understands the game really well, takes responsibility. 'So it's nice when those type of people get the rewards, which is a reward for their hard work and effort.'", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103486-its-strange-graham-potter-surprised-criticism-fantastic-chelsea-star"},

The 37-year-old had a goal ruled out in the second half after he felt Fabian Schar had taken Newcastle's free kick instead of giving the ball back to goalkeeper Nick Pope. Ronaldo was handed only his second start in the Premier League this season for the game against Newcastle and was replaced in the 72nd minute by Marcus Rashford, who missed an excellent chance to win the game for United late on. Ronaldo looked less than impressed when he saw his number held up and repeatedly shook his head as he trudged towards the touchline. After the match, Ronaldo's sister Elma Aveiro shared a post from a Portuguese football account which revealed Ten Hag's reason why the forward was substituted along with the message: 'If it continues like this, Ten Hag won't last until January.' But above a picture the post, Elma Aveiro wrote: 'It's too late.' Speaking ahead of United's clash with Tottenham on Wednesday, Ten Hag said of Ronaldo's reaction: 'I think no player is happy when they get off and especially not Ronaldo. 'As long as it is in quite a normal way no problem with that.' Ten Hag also defended his United players after the club were charged by the Football Association for their reaction towards referee Craig Pawson after he disallowed Ronaldo's goal. 'I don't think it was too strong but I don't know what's happening exactly on the pitch as it's too far away for me on the pitch,' said Ten Hag. 'I've seen the video, there was a touch from the player from Newcastle that's quite clear and they wanted to point that to the referee. 'First of all, I want to express we always accept the referees' decision but it's also quite normal to ask why in the moment, it was a curious incident, you ask as a team why. But finally and quite clear you have to accept it. Then you have to move on. 'You are right we are example for amateurs and youth, quite clear. We have to know our role but it's also about professional football so when it's a decision like this, and it was quite obvious a player touched the ball from Newcastle, our players took advantage of it to ask why.'", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103488-cristiano-ronaldos-sister-hits-manchester-united-manager-erik-ten"},

IPOB's counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, stated this in a statement titled, UPDATE ON OUR TODAY'S VISIT TO OUR INDEFATIGABLE CLIENT - ONYENDU MAZI NNAMDI KANU, AT THE DSS HEADQUARTERS, ABUJA\", made available to   on Thursday night after visiting Kanu who is still in the custody of the Department of State Services. Ejiofor noted that a late-night notice was served by the case's lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, on Wednesday night and was due for a hearing on October 24. Ejiofor noted that, though the Federal Government had the right to appeal, it must first obey the order of the Court of Appeal directing the immediate and unconditional release of Kanu. He said, \"Our strategies towards a successful upsetting of the efficacy of these processes as it affects Onyendu's unconditional release were discussed with him, which strategies were all acceptable to him, particularly now that the Motion for Stay of Execution was fixed for hearing on Monday, being the 24th day of October 2022. \"Though the FGN's right of appeal is a Constitutional Right, it is our firm contention that the FGN must, first and foremost, obey the Order of the Court of Appeal directing for the immediate and unconditional release of Onyendu. The FGN has been in contempt of the positive Orders of the Court made since October 13, 2022, by the Court of Appeal, which Orders clearly discharged Onyendu and prohibited the FGN from further detaining him and/or subjecting him to any further prosecution or trial. \"The law is settled that a party who is in disobedience of a Court Order cannot be entitled to, or be granted the indulgence of the exercise of the equitable discretion of a Court of Law for Stay of Execution of the same Order the party is in its contempt. \"Onyendu's legal team, eminently led by our erudite Silk, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, is ever ready to literally remove the carpet from under their feet in Court, come October 24, 2022. \"There is no doubt whatsoever that this grossly incompetent application for Stay of Execution is to enable the lawless DSS to gain more time with the continued detention of Onyendu, but their evil plan is dead on arrival because we are equal to the task! \"The only valid option available to the FGN now is to obey the Order made by a very Superior Court of Record, and immediately free Onyendu unconditionally. \"Onyendu is strongly convinced that our landmark victory resonates with the age-long testament that the Court is the last hope of the common man. He is firm in his conviction that this landmark victory has come to stay, and his freedom is sacrosanct. \"Umuchineke are strongly assured that the present development is nothing to worry about. The Judgment of the Court of Appeal freeing Onyendu has held the FGN in a vice-like grip, there is no chance whatsoever of extrication. Onyendu's freedom is sacrosanct and the sanctity of the Court's pronouncement must be respected by the FGN, and the time is now! \"Onyendu extended his profound gratitude to you all, UmuChineke, while encouraging you all to remain fervent in your supplications and prayers, as this travail will soon be a thing of the past.

The Belgium international also picked up the prize for best goalkeeper, named after Lev Yashin, the only goalkeeper to receive the Ballon d'Or in the award's history in 1963. \"The truth is that I think it's impossible,\" Courtois said to RTVE when asked if a goalkeeper could win the award again. \"Obviously Karim deserves it, we all agree with that. But after the year I had as a goalkeeper, you win the Champions League, you win the league, you play the Champions League final and your team wins it thanks to your saves, and you only end up seventh [...] that says a lot. \"The votes don't go towards goalkeepers.

Sadly, motorists passing through communities have had to make a detour passing through longer routes to get to their destinations. Many roads have been washed away, many farmlands, houses, vehicles and other properties have succumbed to the overpowering effect of flooding. Findings show the country is facing its worst flooding in a decade with the National Emergency authorities describing the situation as \"beyond control\". While the devastating flood situation has become a recurring decimal, different narratives have been put forward as the cause. The flooding has been linked to heavy rainfalls, overflow of local rivers, and the devastating impacts of climate change but most consequentially to the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in Northern Cameroon. NEMA in a terse press statement on September 19 said: \"The Lagdo dam operators in the Republic of Cameroon have commenced the release of excess water from the reservoir by September 13, 2022. \"We are aware that the released water cascades down to Nigeria through River Benue and its tributaries thereby inundating communities that have already been impacted by heavy precipitation\" According to findings by our correspondent, the construction of the Lagdo Dam started in 1977 and was completed in 1982. Records indicate that Cameroon and Nigeria were supposed to build two dams at inception, such that the Nigerian dam, known as Dasin Hausa dam which was to be in Adamawa State, would contain water released from the Lagdo Dam at any point in time. The Dasin Hausa dam was supposed to be two and a half the size of the Lagdo dam, meant to supply electricity to the northern part of Cameroon and also aid irrigation. But sadly, have the absence of dams to control the excesses from Cameroon's dam have continued to cause serious consequences on frontline states and communities along the courses of rivers Niger and Benue. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Farouq said Nigeria will \"initiate a bilateral discussion with authorities in Cameroon next month (November 2022) on the periodic opening of the Lagdo Dam\". Meanwhile, various spirited efforts are being made and put in place to provide succour to the victims of this devastating floods.", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103487-quick-facts-cameroons-lagdo-dam-causing-floods-nigeria"},

The Ozubulu- Anambra State born screen diva lamented that she wants a man that would love her for who she is not as a TV star. Here are excerpts from the interview ; \nMy name is Nazo Ekezie. I am from Anambra State. Ozubulu to be precise. I'm the second child of four children. My father is late but my mother is still here. \nI have been here professionally since 2010. \nThey were couple of movies I did. Two or three scenes, sometimes 5 then I go back to school but THANKS FOR COMING produced by Uche Nancy brought me to limelight. After than I did another one titled Assassins with the likes of Mike Ezuruonye, Chacha Eke, and other. They were couple of other ones, but these were the movies that made people take me seriously as an actor. As some point I wanted to try something new. I developed this love for filmmaking. It has been there for a while. So, in 2018, I produced my first film. It's titled Flawed. Featuring Ebere Okaro, More Duncan, my humble self, and other amazing actors. There was no particular criteria before I choose my cast because I am that kind of person that watches movies a lot. So, if I see new faces that know their onions well, I take note of them. I have this producer eye. \nSo, it wasn't really difficult for me to know who and who would be in my film. I had taken mental note of those that I wanted. \nI called them up negotiated with them and that was it. \nThis particular production, would be on CD and for the internet. What were the challenges you passed through as first time producer? \nI think doing a movie as a producer and also acting in same movie should be for only superheroes, because it was not easy at all. I had to think for everyone to make sure that the production goes well. It was not funny at all. I had to think from every angle to make sure everything was okay. I had a very good production manager, but I really got myself worked up. \nWell, some people said it's because it was my first time, that soon, I'd get used to it. \nAnother big challenge, I had was location issue. I paid for an office space in Lekki, then like a day before the shoot, the man in charge of the space called and said we can't move in that the office was locked. Some government officials locked the place up. Then, he wouldn't refund my money on time to get another office space. It was very tough, but I refused to be discouraged. \nWe just changed plans and moved on. \nThe good thing is, I have learned my lessons. Now I know what those other producers face. What they pass through. Now I understand them better. I have learned anything can go wrong during production. And most times, some mistakes or lapses is not entirely their faults. \nFlawed the movie, is trying to say that people have reasons for doing what they do. We all are not perfect. No matter how good and perfect we seem to look from the outside, there are lots of issues we still have to deal with on the inside. \nThere are certain actions that people take and nobody would truly understand why, until he or she gets close to realise the reason behind that action. Nobody, male nor female should sit in one corner and criticize anybody's actions without knowing what prompted it. \nEverybody struggles with something. No matter how popular you are, no matter how great you look, there's a demon you're fighting within. Nobody everyone around you would understand. \nThe movie also teaches that love concurs. That love would make everything right again. These days everyone, especially celebrities are always online showing off different lifestyle, what's your take on? \nI can only say that it depends on who and what you want for yourself. \nI think my biggest problem is realness. I don't know how to fake it or pretend. I can't even snap besides someone's car because there is no gain in it. I'm so real to a fault. Although the society would expect more from us as a celebrities. A lot of actors are pressured by the society. Nigerians are conflicted, they want you to be humble, then the next minute, the complain you are too humble. \nThese problems are often created by women. So, if people tend to live fake lifestyles, I won't blame them. They have to meet up. \nI'm very very single and available. \nIn the course of my job as an actor, there are too many expectations from celebrities. One thing about famous people is that most times, they don't change but people around them do. I have always looked out for someone who fame doesn't entice or affect. One wouldn't consider it a problem. I want someone who would be patient enough to know me and not look at me from the movie angle. I would love someone who sees me as Nazo and not an actress all the time. Right now, I want to be in a relationship so bad. I want to be someone I love, someone who loves me as me, but not as an actress or movie star. I want to be with a person that actually knows me, loves me and willing to relate with me as Nazo. Well, I'm not a physical look kind of person but then you won't be looking like masquerade though. I want an OK looking guy, average. And most importantly the acceptance that I'm talking about. Then your brain is more important to me and how the mind functions. That one it's so important. I'm not looking out to marry a Dangote but he needs to be comfortable. He has to be able to provide for me. These are the issues. \n(Laughs). It might sound clich\u00e9 but I don't wear pants anymore. Because I'm not going to joke with my destiny and if there's anywhere that I'm taking my clothes off, my underwear are going straight to my bag. (Laughs)There are other things you can wear. You don't have to go out naked. At first I took it as a joke but now it's very serious matter. So, no more Pants.", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2019/01/61681-i-man-bad-actress-nazo-ekezie"},

But his proposal was quickly met with backlash-including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The world's richest man and Tesla founder on Monday, October 3, suggested elections in the annexed regions under United Nations supervision. \"Russia leaves if this is the will of the people,\" he said. He also said Crimea, the Ukranian city annexed by Russia in 2014 originally belonged to Russia until a 'mistake' by former Soviet Union premier, Nikita Khrushchev. He called for the Crimea to formally become part of Russia. Then, he said Crimea's water supply should be assured. And lastly, he argued, Ukraine should remain neutral rather than joining NATO. Musk then shared a Twitter poll asking his followers to give their opinion on his suggestion. \"Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev's mistake),\"\u00a0 He also opined that Ukraine should remain neutral and asked followers to reply with their recommendations in \"yes and no\". \"This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end ' just a question of how many die before then,\" Musk said. He added that the war could turn nuclear although it is unlikely. Less than three hours after his first tweet, Zelensky responded to Musk with his own poll, mocking Musk's plan. \"Which @elonmusk do you like more?\" Zelensky asked. The two choices? One who supports Ukraine, and one who supports Russia. Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, also piled on Musk in atypical fashion for a diplomat. \"Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,\" he wrote. Melnyk later added that no Ukrainian would ever buy a Tesla, telling Musk \"good luck.\" [/b] Musk, however, persisted. \"Let's try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas & Crimea should decide whether they're part of Russia or Ukraine,\" he wrote-asking his Twitter followers to answer either \"yes\" or \"no.\" However, Times correspondent Christopher Miller replied to Musk's tweet, referring to the Ukrainian Independence Referendum, when Ukrainians were asked to vote on the country's independence In March, Elon Musk had publicly challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a \"single combat\" for Ukraine. Taking to Twitter, the SpaceX CEO wrote, \"I hereby challenge Vladimir Putin to single combat\".

{"headline": "China bans exams for six-year-old school children", "image_url": "https://static.netnaija.com/i/DpraRP1jKAo.jpg", "author": "Same Emmanuel", "posted_date": "Aug 30, 2021", "description": "China has announced a ban on written exams for six and seven-year-olds. It's the latest effort to try and relieve pressure on parents and students in a highly competitive education system. Students used to be required to take exams from the first year of primary school, up until a university entrance exam at the age of 18. But the education ministry said the pressure is harming the \"physical and mental health\" of pupils. In a statement, the ministry said: \"Exams are a necessary part of school education.... [but] some schools have problems like excessive exams, that cause excessive burden on students...this must be corrected.\" The rules also limits the number of test and exams a school can set per term. \"First and second grades of elementary school will not need to take paper-based exams. For other grades, the school can organise a final exam every semester. Mid-term exams are allowed for junior high. Localities are not allowed to organise regional or inter-school exams for all grades of primary school,\" the Ministry of Education (MOE) added. \"Non-graduating junior high students are also not allowed to organise weekly tests, unit exams, monthly exams etc. Examinations disguised under various names like academic research is also not allowed.\" Reaction on China's social media platform Weibo was mixed with some saying it was a step in the right direction to relieve pressure on children. Others questioned how schools will test and measure abilities without exams. The announcement is part of wider reforms in China's education sector. In July, Beijing stripped online tutoring firms operating in the country of the ability to make a profit from teaching core subjects. The new guidelines also restricted foreign investment in the industry and disrupted the private tutoring sector which was worth around $120bn (\u00a387bn) before the overhaul. At the time, the move was seen as authorities trying to ease the financial pressures of raising children, after China posted a record low birth rate. Education inequality is also a problem - more affluent parents are willing to spend thousands to get their children into top schools. The country's obsession with education also affects property prices, with wealthier parents snapping up property in school catchment areas. China's Ministry of Education has also banned homework for first graders this year, and limited homework for junior high school students to 1.5 hours a night, according to an AFP report.", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2021/08/89463-china-bans-exams-year-school-children"},

The duo was first charged before a Yaba Chief Magistrate's Court alongside two others, Mumuni Toheeb, 21, and Mubarak Soliu, 20, in January 2022 for allegedly receiving a Spark S Tecno phone valued at N60,000 that belonged to the deceased. However, when the case came up on February 14, Chief Magistrate Olatunbosun Adeola said a prima facie case had been established against Mohammed and Jamiu. She ordered that the two teenagers should face trial at the High Court following the legal advice from the DPP and also ordered that Toheeb and Soliu be discharged based on the recommendation of the DPP. When the matter came up on Thursday, October 20, at the state High court sitting in Tinubu, Lagos Island, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dr Babajide Martins, informed the court that the matter was for arraignment. Martins told the court that the defendants conspired among themselves and allegedly killed Dada in December 2, 2021, around 12noon, in the RCCG, Road 13, 6th Avenue, FESTAC area of Lagos. He said they killed the deceased by hitting him on the head with a wooden plank and a bottle. The prosecutor also told the court that the duo robbed the deceased of his bag and a mobile phone. Following their arraignment, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. In view of their pleas, Justice Sonaike ordered their remand in custody and adjourned the case till November 29 for trial. The remanded teenagers visited the  RCCG Chapel of Resurrection on 13 Road, 6th Avenue, FESTAC Town last Sunday November 2021. During the altar call, they came out and pledge to give their lives to Jesus Christ. After the service, they met with late Dada and informed him they had nowhere to stay as they were stranded. The church leaders offered them the church premises to stay pending when they will be able to help them get a place. It was while they were in the church that they allegedly attacked and killed Dada.", "newspaper_name": "TheNetNaija Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://www.torizone.com/posts/2022/10/103595-court-remands-teenagers-murder-rccg-pastor-festac-town"},
