Mr Adamu said this when he spoke with journalists on Thursday in Abuja. The ruling party conducted its presidential primary at a special national convention in Abuja in June. A former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, beat 13 other aspirants including former Rivers governor, Rotimi Amaechi, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to emerge winner. Some of the aspirants stepped down for Mr Tinubu. \u201cTo the best of our knowledge they are keying into our 2023 presidential project. \u201cEach of the aspirants to the presidency of this country that presented himself during our June convention is still alive and still in the party. \u201cAs for reconciliation, it is a work in progress, we have been doing it and have been talking to them individually and we will continue doing that,\u201d he said. The APC national chairman said that the party needed the support and collaboration of the media in its quest to achieve an overwhelming victory in the 2023 general election. Mr Adamu said also that no any party has equalled APC\u2019s achievements in the area of youth inclusiveness. He said the APC stood out among other political parties in ensuring youths inclusiveness in governance and politics.

Ifeanyi Ejiofor, a lawyer to Mr Kanu confirmed receipt of court filings concerning the appeal. Mr Ejiofor in a telephone interview with PREMIUM TIMES on Thursday said Mr Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), received a copy of the court documents on the appeal at 5 p.m on Wednesday. It was learnt that the government contended in its notice of appeal that the Court of Appeal was wrong to have faulted Mr Kanu\u2019s extraordinary rendition to Nigeria and gone ahead to strike out the charges against him on that basis. It also argued the court erred when it struck out the pending terrorism charge against the IPOB leader. The Court of Appeal in Abuja, had on 13 October,  by the government. It held that the IPOB leader was \u201cextraordinarily renditioned\u201d to Nigeria in flagrant violation of the country\u2019s extradition treaty and Mr Kanu\u2019s fundamental human rights. The court ordered the release of Mr Kanu from the custody of the   (SSS), where he has been detained since he was brought back to Nigeria in June last year. But the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and his counterpart at the Ministry of Police Affairs, Muhammad Dingyadi, argued the Court of Appeal only discharged Mr Kanu and did not acquit him. \u201cLet it be made clear to the general public that other issues that predate rendition on the basis of which Kanu jumped bail remain valid issues for judicial determination. \u201cThe Federal Government will consider all available options open to us on judgment on rendition while pursuing determination of pre-rendition issues,\u201d Mr Malami had said The claims by the minister have been faulted by lawyers as a hollow basis for continuing to detain a suspect whose charges have been struck out. In addition to appealing against the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, the government has applied to the Supreme Court for an order staying execution of the power\u2019s judgement. The AGF\u2019s office filed the request for stay of execution on Thursday. Mr Kanu was first arrested in 2015 and charged with various offences including treasonable felony over his separatist activities championing the secession of South-east and some parts of the South-south as an independent Biafra nation. He was granted bail and released in 2017. But he subsequently fled the country in September the same year after soldiers invaded his home in Afara-Ukwu near Umuahia, Abia State. That same month, the government obtained an order of the Federal High Court in Abuja proscribing IPOB and designating it as a terrorist organisation. Mr Kanu, a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United Kingdom (UK), is believed to have settled down in the UK after leaving Nigeria. But he was arrested in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria in June last year. The government then raised the charges against him from seven to 15 to include terrorism offences he allegedly committed by inciting violence through social media posts. But in a ruling delivered on 8 April, on an application by by Mr Kanu\u2019s legal team, the trial judge, Binta Nyako, of the Federal High Court in Abuja, struck out eight of the 15 counts. Mrs Nyako threw out counts 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12,13 and 14 which she ruled were repetitive and invalid. Displeased that the judge did not strike out the entire charges, Mr Kanu further appealed to the Court of Appeal. In its judgement on 13 October, a three-member panel of the Court of Appeal led by Oludotun Adefope-Okojie struck out the remaining seven terrorism charges, on the grounds that the government breached both local and international laws in Mr Kanu\u2019s forcible rendition to Nigeria. It held that the trial court, the Federal High Court, lacked jurisdiction to continue Mr Kanu\u2019s trial as a result of the breach of his fundamental rights by state agents. \u201cBy the illegal abduction and extra-ordinary rendition of the appellant, there was a clear violation, by the respondent (Fed Govt) of international treaties, conventions, as well as the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right,\u201d Mr Adefope-Okojie said.

He said the country has only experienced disruptions, not  . Mr Jedy-Agba stated this on Thursdsy when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Power investigating the frequent collapse of the national grid. The country had suffered total blackout four times this year reportedly occasioned by the collapse of the grid. The Minister explained that disruption could cause blackout. \u201cSo, please let us understand that we have not had any collapse this year, we have had disruptions and disruptions could lead to blackouts, a blackout is not a collapse. \u201cThese ones we have had this year, in fact, four of them, but they have not been collapse, it is disruption. And disruptions have been as a result of the human factors, they could be increment factors, they could be political factors, it could be other factors,\u201d he said. Mr Jedy-Agba blamed the unavailability of gas for some of the disruptions experienced so far this year. \u201cGas supply has been a problem but we are tackling that already because we are discussing with NNPC and Nigerian Gas Corporation. We are coming to an agreement and gas is flowing systematically now to the generating companies and we are seeing a steady increment in generation,\u201d the minister said However, Electricity Generation Companies (GenCos), blamed the incessant national electricity grid collapse on weak transmission lines. Joy Ogaji, the executive secretary of the association of power generation companies, said the infrastructure   (TCN) cannot cope with the load. She explained that often, the transmission lines are experiencing volatility which causes disruptions. She added that often, GENCOs are using their infrastructure to transmit load. \u201cThere is service interruption due to the inability of DISCOS to take the load, weak grid conditions forcing apparatus disruption, TCN radial lines\u2026.most of TCN lines are radial, not double circuit, thereby limiting the redundancy in the system which increases system instability, Inadequate and old infrastructure to meet demands, transmission and distribution manned by insufficient engineers and technicians, poor communication and coordination of activities between TCN and Discos,\u201d she said. Also speaking, the Managing Director of Transmission Company of Nigeria, Sule Abdulaziz, contradicted the minister, when he stated that the national grid has collapsed four times in 2022. He added that Nigeria has a transmission capacity of 8,100 megawatts. \u201cWe have four system collapse, then we have two partial collapses and this what we submitted. \u201cOn transmission capacity, we have a capacity of 8,100 megawatts. There is no day when a generation company will say we have generated so much megawatts and TCN is unable to evacuate it. We are challenging generation companies to come out if there is any day that we can not evacuate it\u201d, he said. Following the presentations, the Chairman of the Committee, Magaji Aliyu (APC, Jigawa), stated that the committee will set up a technical committee to prepare a report for the House. He, therefore, adjourned the session sine die. Among Nigeria\u2019s numerous national challenges, which do you think the next president should focus on first?

The   reports that the governor had approved N450 million for relief to about one million displaced people across the eight local government areas of the state. Mr Iworiso-Markson, in a statement, said the fund was grossly inadequate to cater for the feeding, medical support and general welfare of victims of the flood, particularly those around the Ayama axis and Otuokpoti community. \u201cBy the sharing formula, most households could not sustain themselves with the funds beyond a day or two, insisting that more money should be made available to the victims,\u201d he said. Mr Iworiso-Markson, a candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the 2023 Ogbia Federal Constituency election, said that it would be justifiable if the governor approached the assembly to request for special funds to be spent on the flood issue, especially the welfare of the victims. He expressed worry over the looming health crisis that could develop from waterborne and other communicable diseases. Acknowledging the efforts of the state government in the current situation, he also urged the federal government to consider Bayelsa as a special case and step in to complement the efforts of the Diri administration to cushion the effect of the ravaging flood. The former commissioner also called on other agencies of the federal government, multinational companies operating in the state, privileged individuals as well as organisations to see the current issue as a great humanitarian crisis and show support. \u201cNo one is in doubt about the kind of crisis we have now as a result of the flood. This is the time the governor needs to approach the State House of Assembly and ask for their permission to raise and spend more money on the victims. \u201cThis has become inevitable because the affected communities need more money and I urge the governor to step up the flood relief funds because the one released recently is grossly inadequate. It is barely enough to sustain a family for more than two days and our people are suffering. \u201cThe government should also focus on the health needs of the people. I am afraid that the flood may lead to a serious health crisis and this can be avoided if tackled now. \u201cI am also appealing to donor agencies, the federal government and individuals who have the capacity to complement the efforts of the state government,\u201d he said. NAN reports that the   government declared that 300 communities and villages have either been totally or partially submerged by flood in the state.

David Edevbie, a former Commissioner of Finance in the   administration is locked in a battle with  , Delta State House of Assembly speaker over  (Nigeria) governorship ticket for the state\u2019s governorship election in 2023. With the dispute set to be laid to rest on Friday, the supporters of Messrs Edevbie and Oborevwori thronged the Supreme Court complex as early as 7 a.m. Court security operatives battled in vain to control the crowd, but were overwhelmed as they pushed through the human barriers mounted at the Court entry doors. Immediately they vandalised the doors, they trooped into the courtroom like bees, displacing journalists from the press gallery. Mr Edevbie is alleging inconsistencies in the names on the academic certificates submitted by Mr Oborevwori to INEC. According to Mr Edevbie, Mr Oborevwori used the names: Oborevwori, Sheriff, Francis and Orohwedor interchangeably in his certificates submitted to INEC in violation of the Nigerian constitution and the Electoral Act. He contended that Mr Oborevwori was not eligible to participate in the primary election on the grounds of the alleged discrepancies in his academic qualifications. The Federal High Court in Abuja in July nullified Mr Oborevwori\u2019s candidacy while the Court of Appeal in Abuja restored his victory at the PDP primary. Delivering judgement in the suit Taiwo Taiwo, the judge at the Federal High Court held that Mr Edevbie\u2019s suit was meritorious as Mr Oborevwori failed to provide contrary evidence to contradict the claims in the suit. But Mr Taiwo, held that it was premature to declare Mr Edevbie as the candidate of the party since no nomination has been officially made to INEC. The judge also did not declare a fresh primary election to be conducted, saying he did not want to preempt the decision of the party. However, the Court of Appeal voided and set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court which had, on 7 July 2022, nullified Mr Oborevwori\u2019s nomination on grounds of certificate forgery and perjury. Peter Ige, who led the Court of Appeal three-member panel, held that Mr Taiwo\u2019s judgment, which upheld certificate forgery against the Speaker, was a miscarriage of justice because the criminal allegations were not established as required by law. Mt Ige held that claims against the Speaker were criminal in nature and must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court also held that Mr Edevbie, who filed the suit at the Federal High Court, ought to have approached the court via Writ of Summons to enable the resolution of disputes and not by originating summons where only affidavit evidence is required. The judge said the allegations of certificate forgery and faking of documents against the Speaker were such that required witnesses from those who issued the certificates and the alleged fake documents. The court, therefore, upheld the victory of the Speaker at the 25 May 25 primary election where he polled 590 votes to defeat Mr Edevbie who polled only 113 votes to come second.

The sale decision was jointly taken with the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), the government\u2019s bad debt buyer, which took over Skye Bank after the CBN withdrew its licence in 2018 before setting up Polaris as a bridge bank. The new owner, SCIL, has completed a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) for the acquisition of 100% of the equity in Polaris Bank, according to a statement by the spokesperson of the CBN, Osita Nwanisobi. It paid N50 billion and has agreed to refund N1.3 trillion injected into the bank. \u201cAs part of the CBN intervention, consideration bonds with a face value of N898 billion (future value of N1.305 trillion) were injected into the bridge bank through AMCON, to be repaid over a 25-year period. These actions were taken to prevent the imminent collapse of the bank, enable its stabilization and recovery, protect depositors\u2019 funds, prevent job losses and preserve systemic financial stability,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSCIL has paid an upfront consideration of N50 billion to acquire 100% of the equity of Polaris Bank and has accepted the terms of the agreement which include the full repayment of the sum of N1.305 trillion, being the consideration bonds injected. \u201cThe CBN thus received an immediate return for the value it has created in Polaris Bank during the stabilization period, as well as ensuring that all funds originally provided to support the intervention are recovered.\u201d He said the sale was coordinated by a divestment committee comprising representatives of the CBN and AMCON, and advised by legal and financial consultants. \u201cIn the process, parties who had formally expressed an interest in acquiring Polaris Bank, subsequent to the CBN intervention in 2018, were invited to submit financial and technical proposals. Invitations to submit proposals were sent to 25 pre-qualified interested parties, out of which three parties eventually submitted final purchase proposals following technical evaluation,\u201d Mr Nwasinobi said. Polaris took over all assets and liabilities of a collapsing Skye Bank in September 2018 after the withdrawal of its licence by the CBN. The CBN\u2019s regulatory action then was to save depositors\u2019 funds and to ensure that the bank continued as a going concern. Part of the apex bank\u2019s intention was also to stem the imminent job losses to staff if a liquidation option had been adopted.

Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, said this during an interview on  . With over 600 lives lost and properties worth billions destroyed, the country is arguably facing one of its worst flooding incidents in decades. The recent floods have displaced more than a million persons from their homes as some of the government\u2019s infrastructural facilities were also affected by this unprecedented development. Some of the most affected states include Kogi, Anambra, Rivers, Benue, Yobe, Delta, Cross River and Bayelsa. When asked why Nigeria has not declared a state of emergency like neighbouring Chad, Mr Adamu, who admitted the dire conditions of this year\u2019s victims of flood, said Nigeria has not got to that crisis point. He said the country would only do so if all relevant agencies complain of being overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly an emergency situation but it all depends on what you mean by the declaring state of emergency. We have not reached a situation in my view where the relevant emergency management authorities have not been able to deal with this situation. I\u2019m not aware that has happened. \u201cWe have governments, we have the federal government, we have state governments or state emergency management agencies and the Federal Emergency Agency. And I think they have not in any way said that they have been overwhelmed by what they have been doing,\u201d the minister said. Mr Adamu debunked the claim in some quarters that it was poor planning on the part of government that led to the floodings. The minister said the latest cases of flooding in some states in the country were largely human making due to their years of disregard for nature and proper planning. \u201cThe flood is a combination of many things. First and foremost, there is a natural disaster, like an earthquake and everything. There is an act of God but there is also a human aspect to it. For this, one particular thing I will say is that for hundreds of years, well, decades, let me exaggerate. We have been bastardising our watersheds. We have been deforesting our lands, we have been degrading our soil, that is one aspect. \u201cSecondly, many Nigerians just refuse to be law abiding. They have built on water courses, they have blocked drains and water channels. So many activities have been done. Yes. And of course, I will accept that there are certain strategies that are to be taken, maybe engineering solutions, that over a long period of time have not been addressed, but that is also probably because of the nature and the level of our economy. \u201cWater resources management is a very, very expensive venture that is a time consuming venture. To even study alone takes years to be completed. So it is a combination of so many issues, really,\u201d the minister explained. Mr Adamu also dismissed the assumption that the release of water from the Lagbo Dam in   caused the havoc. He said the water contribution of the dam is low compared to the volume of water Nigeria generates internally.

Prime Minister Saleh Kebzabo, who gave the death toll at a news conference, said the government was still compiling casualties from what he described as an armed insurrection. But human rights groups said that unarmed civilians were massacred as security forces brutally cracked down on demonstrations in the capital, N\u2019Djamena, and several other cities. The vast, military-run Central African nation has been in crisis since the April 2021 death of President Idriss Deby, who ruled with an iron fist for three decades. His son, Mahamat Idriss Deby, seized power in the immediate aftermath and initially promised an 18-month transition to elections, but on Oct. 1 he announced they would be pushed back by two years Opposition and civil society groups called for the protests on Thursday, which would have marked the end of an initially agreed-upon 18-month transition period. The government banned them, citing security reasons. But demonstrators showed up early in the morning, barricaded roads, and torched the party headquarters of the new prime minister. \u201cWhat happened today is an armed popular uprising to seize power by force, and those responsible for this violence will face justice,\u201d said Kebzabo, an opponent of Deby\u2019s regime who was named prime minister of a new \u201cunity government\u201d last week. \u201cThe demonstrators had firearms and they are considered rebels. \u201cThe security forces responded only in self-defense,\u201d Kebzabo said. The International Federation for Human Rights and its partner organizations in Chad said the protests were violently repressed by security forces and that cases of live gunfire, torture and arbitrary arrests had been reported. Amnesty International researcher Abdoulaye Diarra said security forces used live rounds on protesters, based on witness accounts and analysis of photos and video from the day. Chadian journalist Oredje Narcisse, who had worked with Reuters in the past, was among the dead, his brother said. Other confirmed victims included a policeman who was fatally wounded in clashes, a 28-year-old protester who was shot in the neck, and Chadian musician Ray\u2019s Kim, who died in a hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that an impartial investigation is needed to determine if protesters resorted to looting and violence and if security forces unlawfully resorted to lethal force across the country,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Riots have been intermittent in Chad since Deby seized power last year, but Thursday\u2019s appeared to be the bloodiest. The government declared a state of emergency and a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., although the president had already declared a state of emergency on Wednesday because of catastrophic floods. \u201cI firmly condemn the repression of demonstrations that led to deaths in Chad,\u201d African Union Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat, who is a former prime minister of Chad, tweeted, calling for a peaceful solution to the crisis. \u201cWe are concerned about the violence in the context of demonstrations in Chad today, which has reportedly led to the loss of lives and injuries,\u201d said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for  . He called on authorities to ensure the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly for all Chadians, and for all parties to refrain from excessive use of force and violence.

Also dropped are a former governor of Enugu State, Chimaroke Nnamani, and that of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, as well as Kassim Afegbua, a former commissioner for information in Edo State. Their names were conspicuously missing from the reviewed PCC list released by the National Secretary of the APC, Iyiola Omisore, late Wednesday. The initial list released in September by the PCC Secretary, James Faleke, had their names as members of the council in different categories. The council was constituted to coordinate the campaign of the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, for the 25 February election. PREMIUM TIMES had exclusively  \u00a0how governors under the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) threatened to sabotage the campaign over the old list, which they claimed ignored their nominated persons. Also, there was a letter that allegedly emanated from the office of the National Chairman of the Party, Abdullahi Adamu, rejecting the composition of the PCC. However, the party disowned the letter. The Chairman of the PGF, Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State, and the Director General of the PCC, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, had reportedly worked on the list to factor in the interest of some senior members of the party. As a result, the inauguration of the PCC and the flag-off of the campaign were suspended. Two weeks ago, the governors met with the NWC members to resolve the matter. In the old list, Mr Aregbesola and some former governors were listed under local government mobilisation. The former governor of Osun State, and a known political ally of Mr Tinubu, recently had a frosty relationship with the APC presidential candidate over the last Osun State governorship election. The minister had opposed the second-term ambition of his successor, Gboyega Oyetola, a relation of Mr Tinubu. In the course of the tussle, Mr Aregbesola had in a video made some unsavoury remarks against Mr Tinubu, whom he served under as works commissioner from 1999 to 2007 when he (Tinubu) was Lagos governor. In the viral video, the minister was seen castigated Mr Tinubu over the political situation in Osun. \u201cWe exalted him (Tinubu) beyond his status and he turned himself to a god over us and we had sworn to ridicule anyone who compared himself to God,\u201d Mr Aregbesola had said during a meeting of the faction of APC he leads. The appearance of Mr Nnamani, a former governor of Enugu State and currently a PDP Senator, in the first list generated controversy on social media. Bayo Onanuga, one of the spokespersons of the PCC, had in a statement   the inclusion of Mr Nnamani, noting that he was included in the council because of his personal relationship with Mr Tinubu. Mr Nnamani, in August, used his  , to   Mr Tinubu, for the reforms in the administration of criminal justice, education, healthcare and employment of non-indigenes when he was governor of Lagos State. Mr Kalu, who is the Senate chief whip, was removed as the APC presidential campaign coordinator for Abia state, according to the reviewed list of the PCC released by the party late Wednesday. He was listed as the coordinator for Abia alongside the party\u2019s governorship candidate in the state, Ikechi Emenike. However, according to the new list, Mr Emenike is now the sole coordinator of the party\u2019s campaign in the South-east state. Mr Kalu had signified interest to jostle for the APC presidential ticket on the ground that the ticket was micro-zoned to the South-east. He later withdrew from the race and  Senate President Ahmad Lawan. A self-confessed non-APC member, Mr Afegbua was included in the initial list as secretary of the public affairs directorate. However, he has now been replaced with Gideon Obakahan in the new list. The former commissioner for information in Edo State has stated it repeatedly that he is not a member of the ruling party, but a supporter of the APC presidential candidate. Another change to the list is the Labour Directorate, where Bobboi Kaigama, the former Trade Union Congress (TUC) president, was initially listed as the director. But in the new list, a former Deputy President of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Issa Aremu, is now the director of the unit. The new list of the PCC also include all NWC members, all APC National Assembly members, all federal executive members, all former governors and deputy governors who are members of APC, all former APC NWC members and all APC National Executive Council members. Others are all serving APC speakers, deputy speakers and principal officers of State Houses of Assembly, all APC former speakers of state assemblies, all APC state chairmen and all APC candidates of national and state assemblies. Meanwhile, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, are still not included in the new list. The ruling party had explained that Presidential Muhammadu Buhari directed that they should be excused from the campaign team to enable them focus on governance during the campaign season.

Private institutions shall be strongly encouraged to do likewise,\u201d he said. It is unclear how Mr Tinubu plans to encourage the members of the National Assembly to support gender legislation. Early this year, the lawmakers rejected five gender bills, prompting protests by women at the entrance of the National Assembly in Abuja. For days, the women besieged the entrance of the National Assembly and demanded the reversal of the bills. Following the protests, the   rescinded its decisions on three out of the five bills. The House rescinded its decision on the bill that seeks to amend section 26 (2a) of the 1999 constitution by opening citizenship registration to males and females. This means that if the bill is passed, foreigners married to Nigerian women can apply for Nigerian citizenship. Similarly, the other bill seeks to alter Sections 31 and 318(1) (the Interpretation Section) of the 1999 Constitution to allow a woman to become an indigene of her husband\u2019s state after at least six years of marriage. Also, another seeks to amend Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution to provide 35 per cent affirmative action to ensure women occupy at least 35 per cent in political party administration. But the bills that sought to create extra seats for women in legislative Houses and the 20 per cent quota for women for appointment into federal and states cabinets were not considered. So far, aside from the rescission, the bills have not been listed for consideration by the committee of the whole. Three cabinet positions for under 40, six for under 50 Mr Tinubu said, if elected, his administration will reserve minimum of three cabinet positions for Nigerians under the age of 40, while six cabinet positions will be reserved for under 50. In addition, Mr Tinubu said 20 per cent of political appointments at Ministries, Departments and Agencies are going to be reserved for qualified people under the age of 40. \u201cReserve at least three cabinet positions for persons under the age of 40 and six more positions for members under the age of 50. \u201cWe shall also pass a presidential directive requiring that at least 20 per cent of political appointments to MDAs be reserved for qualified people under the age of forty,\u201d the document reads in part.

Nigerian authorities have announced over 500 deaths from floods that have affected about half of the country\u2019s 36 states. Millions of people have also been displaced by the floods. The US support fund will allow local partners on the ground to provide emergency shelter assistance, relief commodities, and hygiene kits to promote safe and healthy practices amid the ongoing cholera outbreak. The fund, through the   (USAID), will also provide multipurpose cash assistance for people impacted by the devastating floods. According to the US Mission in Nigeria, the floods have exacerbated an already critical humanitarian situation in Nigeria, where ongoing conflict, especially in the northern region, has driven millions of people from their homes. \u201cIn the same region, more than 4 million people are projected to continue experiencing acute food insecurity amid the worsening global food crisis,\u201d it said in a statement. It added that the mission is also concerned that standing floodwaters could increase the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states, where cholera outbreaks were declared in August and September and at least 7,750 cases were recorded. \u201cWe are filled with grief for the flood victims who have lost so much \u2013 livelihoods, homes, and even loved ones,\u201d said US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard. \u201cThe United States continues to stand with the people of Nigeria during this extremely difficult time,\u201d she added. The mission noted that as experts expect heavy rainfall and flooding to continue through November, due in part to climate change and insufficient drainage infrastructure, USAID disaster experts will continue monitoring the situation in close coordination with humanitarian partners and the Government of Nigeria to assess needs and determine if additional assistance is required. In 2022, USAID provided more than $356 million in humanitarian assistance to people most affected by conflict and food insecurity in Nigeria. This assistance is in addition to USAID\u2019s annual $539 million development budget for Nigeria which supports economic growth, health, democratic governance, and education.

Before that, it held a symposium for referees on Friday in Ikenne as part of the kick-off activities. Having organised two successful seasons in the last two years, the organisers met with the referees to prepare for a new and seamless season. The symposium focused on how the relationship between players and referees can be improved and also on the new modifications by the organisers for the new season. During the opening speech, the Director of the League, Olumide Ajibolade, told participants the TCC began in 2020 after the   period and it took nine months to plan in terms of organisation and including teams that have a shared vision. The road to a third consecutive   title begins tomorrow.    \u2014 Beyond Limits FA (@Beyond_LimitsFA)  Ajibolade, who is also the coach of Beyond Limits, said that the league was created to solve a need for the inadequate competition from the \u201c  to NLO 2 club sides\u201d. \u201cAnother was the development of grassroots football, which involves the need for more sponsorship deals to be made for all the clubs. Every club contributed the same amount of fees, with no bigger shareholders. The third season begins tomorrow and I can tell you that most private leagues don\u2019t survive up to three seasons,\u201d he added. Achievements recorded by the league in the last two seasons were that no single match was abandoned and no referee was assaulted in all 184 and 129 games, respectively. Ajibolade continued, \u201cThus the symposium is to improve the most critical part of the TCC as the league begins on Saturday.\u201d Meanwhile, the Chairman of the TCC, Bankole Atiba, also addressed the referees to put professionalism first in their duties. Atiba added that the TCC league is focused on creating an enabling environment for the referees to perform. While addressing Journalists, Atiba said the vision of the TCC is to groom players who will reach the highest level of their careers. He further added that the league had achieved in terms of players\u2019 transfers abroad because of the standard and competitiveness. \u201cAs I speak with you, not less than 10 players are in the process of moving out of the country. That\u2019s one thing that I can say is one achievement of the TCC league. The league can only be sustainable when there are player sales. \u201cWe also have about two players from Beyond Limits who have played in the U-17 and U-20 national teams.\u201d To further enable less controversial cases on the pitch, TCC organisers with its technology partners, Kiniscore will deploy video communication gadgets for the referees during the games.

For Aribo and Onyeka, it was even worse, with Manchester City beating Southampton 4-0 and Brentford losing 5-1 to Newcastle United, respectively. Unlike his other two compatriots, who came on as substitutes, Aribo was in action from the blast of the whistle at the Etihad Stadium. However, unlike he did last weekend when he scored against Everton, Aribo huffed and puffed against City before making way for Juan Larios Lopez in the 79th minute. The latest defeat for the Saints, the fourth in quick succession, has seen Aribo and his teammates hover around the relegation zone. With seven points from nine games, Southampton presently occupy the 16th position on the Premier League table, though they are just one point above those in the relegation zone. City made the Saints bleed as Erling Haaland maintained his excellent goal-scoring form, netting once more this season after netting hat-tricks in his previous three home Premier League games. City\u2019s opening goal came on 20 minutes from Joao Cancelo before Phil Foden doubled the advantage moments later as the hosts took a healthy 2-0 lead into halftime. Five minutes after the restart, City put the game to bed when Rodri\u2019s clipped pass to Riyad Mahrez was smartly volleyed past Southampton goalkeeper and former City Academy player Gavin Bazunu. On 65 minutes, Haaland finally got in on the act with a goal of his own. The victory momentarily puts City on top of the Premier League, although Arsenal will regain the top spot if they beat Liverpool on Sunday. At St. James\u2019 Park, Onyeka and his Brentford teammates were hammered 5-1 by the high-flying Newcastle United team who have now moved up to the sixth position in the EPL standings. Bryan Mbeumo thought he\u2019d opened the scoring after 10 minutes for Brentford, but a VAR check chalked off the goal for an offside. Newcastle, buoyed by the cancellation of Brentford\u2019s opener, took the lead with 22 minutes on the clock when Bruno Guimaraes headed in from Kieran Trippier\u2019s cross. Six minutes later, Callum Wilson crossed for Jacob Murphy to tap into the empty net. Ivan Toney reduced the deficit with a 54th-minute penalty awarded for a handball by Dan Burn, but Guimaraes\u2019 long-range blast restored Newcastle\u2019s two-goal advantage two minutes later. Miguel Almiron struck in the 81st minute and Ethan Pinnock\u2019s 90th-minute own goal completed Brentford\u2019s dismal day.  could not save the day as Bournemouth put under-fire Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers back on the hot seat with a 2-1 win at the Vitality Stadium. Leicester took the lead in the 10th minute when Patson Daka slotted home. Bournemouth equalised in the 67th minute through Philip Billing, who volleyed into the roof of the net following a mistake from Wout Faes. Ryan Christie completed Bournemouth\u2019s comeback in the 71st minute with a close-range finish after Dominic Solanke flicked on Billing\u2019s cross. Though Rodgers threw in Iheanacho afterward, the Nigerian forward could not improve the fortunes of the Foxes this term. Having won for the first time this season on Monday, Leicester have now lost seven of their last eight games. Goals from Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic, and Armando Broja propelled Chelsea to a 3-0 win over struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge.

The games are dicey for the Nigerian clubs, who host the first legs in Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Lagos. Rivers United, the NPFL defending champions, will be up against   and Morocco\u2019s league defending champions, Wydad Athletics in Port Harcourt. Plateau United are in Abuja and line up against Esperance de Tunis while Kwara United will host Confederations Cup winners, RS Berkane at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Lagos. All these games are scheduled to be held on Sunday, 9 October. However, the big question is if these clubs won\u2019t suffer the same fate as Remo Stars in the hands of the North African sides on Sunday. The recent promise of N28 million by Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike is the biggest motivation for the NPFL champions, whose last competitive game was in September. Can money be enough to beat the North African teams? Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has promised Rivers United players N28 million each to beat Wydad AC (Morocco) on Sunday in the CAF Champions League second round first leg qualifiers in Port Harcourt.  \u2014 Adepoju Tobi Samuel \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec (@OgaNlaMedia)  Their test is against CAF Champions League winner, Wydad, who are already involved in the 2022/2023 Moroccan Botola season. Meanwhile, Rivers United have failed to scale the two North African hurdles in their last two qualifications. The most recent was the loss to Al Masry of Egypt, via away goals rule at the Confederation Cup third preliminary round. Rivers won 2-1 at home only to suffer a lone goal loss on the road. The second was against the Al Hilal Club of Sudan who defeated Rivers United 2-1 on aggregate at the Champions League. With this precedence, Rivers United face not just a top side but a favourite to reach the group stage. Wydad has not missed out on the CAF Champions League group stage in the last three seasons. The last time they visited Nigeria was against Lobi Stars at the Tafawa Balewa Stadium, Bauchi, and it ended 1-0 in favour of the visitors from Mohamed Nahiri\u2019s 20th-minute finish. Therefore, Rivers United will bank on some of their players, like Joseph Onoja, Ebube Duru, and Kenechukwu Agu. Wydad, who won their last two games in the Botola league will entrust their goal-scoring to Bouly Junior Sambou, who has scored two goals so far this season, and Yahia Attiyat Allah. Plateau at the MKO Abiola Stadium will make the most decisions of their campaign in the CAF Champions League against Esperance de Tunis on Sunday. Esperance, just like Wydad, have made it to the CAF group stage game in the last three seasons. As it stands, Plateau United are the underdogs to Esperance defeated Nigerian side, Sunshine Stars on home soil, in 2012. Esperance aren\u2019t just known for their cohesive style of play but as an all-attacking team. After their performance in 2007, Kwara United has reached the second round of the CAF Confederations Cup where they will play against RS Berkane at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Lagos. Meanwhile, the Moroccans are not in great form right now, having lost their last two games in the league this season. Berkane are the defending champions and have continental pedigree, which means Kwara United will need a wide goal margin against Berkane to be on a better keel for the second leg.

Civil servants, who work as football administrators will agree that this is one industry that brings out the best and worst in its employees, painfully and publicly. But one man who has used generosity to his advantage is the newly elected President of the  , Ibrahim Gusau. According to close associates, the new NFF president\u2019s sense of humanity is such that any encounter with him turns into quality time and when he speaks, people listen. This is because he is always eager to demonstrate his problem-solving abilities when approached with life\u2019s challenges. That is significant in an era when Nigerian football has faced an unprecedented invasion of the evils of corruption, match-fixing, hooliganism, and a lack of accountability from the country\u2019s football governing body. No one knows the difficulties he has overcome better than he, who is from Zamfara, a state presently known as a haven for terrorists and bandits. His state\u2019s insecurity impeded his tireless efforts at establishing a football academy. Mr Gusau, an unassuming but thoroughbred administrator, rose through the ranks in the game, serving as Team Manager of Zamfara State\u2019s Club 50, Sambo Babes, and Zamfara United football clubs, as well as Kassim Stars FC in Sokoto State, before being elected to the board of the Zamfara State Football Association. A trained accountant, Mr Gusau rose through the ranks to become the Director of Finance in Zamfara State, where he served for over three decades. His desire to be the best in his field led him to work as a special assistant to former NFF president Aminu Maigari. Mr Gusau\u2019s track record provided evidence that his viewpoint is that of an insider who has been very close to the seat of power. At the national level, he defeated Ifeanyi Ubah for the second time in a row in 2018 to become chairman of Chairmen of the NFF board under Amaju Pinnick\u2019s administration. Mr Gusau has served on the African Nations Championship organising committee, is a CAF Safety and Security Officer, and is presently a member of CAF\u2019s organising committee for the U17, U20, and U23 youth competitions. The 58-year-old was once a special adviser to the governor of Zamfara State on the environment and has spent eight years as the Chairman of the Nigeria Football Committee, among other high-level positions. He knows the Glass House like the back of his hand. However, all that ended after the NFF elective congress chose him as the new President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) after he polled 39 votes out of 40 votes in a runoff election. The northern caucus endorsed him after stating the baton of leadership had to return to the north. The speed with which he is being ushered in shows how desperately state chairmen wanted a change in the Glass House. Mr pinnick\u2019s reign was a one-man show, marked by a series of controversies both on and off the field. He had no choice but to abandon his dreams of running for a third term in office because he was no longer wanted by his federation. The former Zamfara State Sports Commission Chairman from 2009 to 2010 has his hands full after assuming full rein as the new NFF president. He promised to boost football, from the grassroots level in individual states of the federation, and to focus more on players\u2019 welfare. Also, he said television deals and building other revenue streams will be priorities while he mentioned private sector involvement in one of his interviews. \u201cThe NPFL, NNL, NLO, and the NWFL for women league are key in the progress of Nigeria Football. If our leagues are vibrant, I believe the successes will reflect on the performances of our national teams,\u201d he said when he declared his candidature. \u201cAnd for us to have strong national teams, both male and female, we have to focus on grassroots football, which is the breeding ground for a better league.\u201d \u201cAnother area our administration will focus on is age-grade football. For our national teams to prosper, the male U17, U20, U23, and their female counterparts will be given all necessary attention.\u201d \u201cThe senior national teams, Super Eagles and Super Falcons will surely get better if our cadet national teams are strong,\u201d he added. The man from Zamfara urged the new board he leads to be pragmatic in their approach to taking Nigerian football to a new height. Having kept his ears as close as possible to the walls of the corridor of powers, he is no football revolutionary, more an evolutionary who feels Nigerian football needs to right the imbalances which have developed between grassroots and professional football. He wants the new board to recognise past failures and fix them. The failures he refers to are well documented. Accountability is one word that most state Football Association (FA) chairmen would not discuss. The Issue of accountability pops up in all spheres of Nigerian football and now is the time for Gusau to embrace transparency in the areas of cash flows such as FIFA grants as well annual budgets from the Sports Ministry. Mr Gusau is said to be forthright in attacking negative influences and he must step up his efforts to run a transparent FA devoid of financial wastage which stems from jamboree trips by state FA Chairmen during Super Eagles matches. These are some of the loose ends he needs to tie up. Secondly, the new NFF president must be ready to appoint technocrats to run the affairs of the NFF Technical department which is the bedrock of football development of every FA. The presence of charlatans in the department cost Nigeria dearly at the 2022 AFCON as well as the country\u2019s failure to qualify for Qatar 2022 World Cup. Also, it should not be business as usual when it comes to the appointment of coaches for various national teams. While the Nigerian sporting press continues to struggle to come to terms with the appointment of Randy Waldrum as coach of the Super Falcons, Mr Gusau must ensure the appointment of national team managers is based on merit, while the recycling of [inept] coaches should be brought to an end. His biggest challenge would be how best to revamp the ailing NPFL league after the Shehu Dikko-led LMC mismanaged the brand. He must ensure league sponsorship deals details are common knowledge before all and sundry unlike in the past when sponsorship figures were secret figures. The league itself needs to be restructured, and that can only be achieved if the new NFF generalissimo can do away with the square pegs in round holes. Finally, many feel Mr Pinnick used his role as NFF president to benefit himself rather than the country\u2019s football. Hence, Mr Gusau must ensure that Nigerian football is less of him and more about the players, coaches, and federation while football politics is minimised to the barest minimum. While the Super Eagles are the most important team under the NFF\u2019s purview, they are not the only national team that needs attention. Gusau and his new board must ensure the Super Falcons and other national teams enjoy commensurate attention in terms of support and logistics. Mr Gusau is the new man in charge in a democracy, but not in the way we know it. Though there are fears that he will choose to deploy the workings of the previous board, no one will care if he can just restore the glory days of Nigerian football.

Unfortunately, the goal was not enough to prevent Everton from losing 2-1 to Manchester United. Goals from Antony and   sealed victory for the Red Devils at Goodison Park. After helping the Toffees to an away win over Southampton last weekend, Iwobi was back with his teammates in search of another three points, this time on home turf. Things appeared to be going according to the script when Iwobi scored a screamer just five minutes into the game. The Nigerian, who had bagged three assists in his last four games, finally opened his goals account and he did it in a sensational style. But United fresh from their Europa League win away to Omonia Nicosia were not ready for back-to-back league defeats having been hammered 6-3 by City last time out. After falling behind to Iwobi\u2019s goal, United levelled within 10 minutes. Summer signing, Antony, became the first United player to score in his first three Premier League games with a cool finish from Anthony Martial\u2019s pass. Unfortunately, the French forward only lasted 30 minutes after pulling up with a hip injury in the warm-up and his departure paved the way for Ronaldo to make his entrance. The five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner just before half time made his introduction count as he made it 2-1; converting the pass from his former Real Madrid teammate, Casemiro. That strike took Ronaldo\u2019s tally in two spells with United to 144. With a record 450 goals for the Spanish giants Real Madrid, 101 goals for Juventus, and five for Sporting Lisbon, Ronaldo accomplished an astonishing 700 club goals to his name. Everton\u2019s seven-match unbeaten run is now over, and the victory by Ten Hag\u2019s men took them up to fifth, within nine points of leaders, Arsenal, with a game in hand.

Jos-based Plateau United on Sunday came from behind to beat Esperance of Tunisia 2-1 in a CAF Champions League second preliminary round first leg fixture in Abuja. Ilechukwu, however, told reporters at a post-match press conference that the result meant both teams still had a 50/50 chance of qualifying for the competition\u2019s group stage. He admitted that even though his team won the match, they still had a lot to do if they hope to progress. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a 50/50 chance for us now because this is football. \u201cAfter all, nobody believed that we were going to win this game due to the experience and pedigree of our opponents. \u201cBefore this game, we had talked to ourselves and had a good discussion on the need to ensure we score a lot of goals in the first leg here at home. \u201cWe have found ourselves in this kind of situation so many times before, even in the local league, and we have always dug deep to emerge victorious at the end. \u201cSo, I wasn\u2019t really bothered when we were a goal down because I knew the quality of players that I have. \u201cI was confident that they will bounce back and win the game,\u201d the coach said. He, however, stated that the job was not yet done. \u201cWe will go back to the drawing and re-strategise to ensure that we perfect our tactics and approach to the game,\u201d Ilechukwu said. He added that their goal ahead of the game was to gain experience and use the first leg to prepare for what they intend to achieve in the return fixture. \u201cSo, we will build from what we have achieved here today and ensure that we approach the second leg with more strength and vigour. \u201cWe are not going to sit back and defend in the second leg in Tunisia, but we will rather come out all guns blazing because we understand what is at stake. \u201cWe will quickly move on from this victory and approach the second leg as though we are still at par with our opponents,\u201d the coach said. Also, Mustapha Ibrahim, scorer of Plateau United\u2019s second goal during the match, expressed gratitude to the fans who turned up to cheer the team. Ibrahim noted that the support was indeed the tonic they needed to turn the game around in their favour. \u201cWe appreciate everyone who came out to support the team, most especially our dear state governor, Simon Lalong, and the   (NFF) President, Ibrahim Gusau. \u201cWe were indeed very happy with the turnout today and we want to assure Nigerians that we remain committed to ensure we work hard and qualify for the group stage,\u201d he said.

While Rivers United and Plateau United managed 2-1 victories over Wydad and Esperance respectively, Kwara United have a two-goal advantage with their 3-1 win over Berkane. As it stands, the Nigerian clubs will have to avoid defeats in Morocco and Tunisia to progress into the next phase though Kwara United can still afford to lose by a single goal margin. Progress for the three Nigerian teams will be historic as the North Africans enjoy a better record in the past meetings. Esperance of Tunis would be fighting for redemption against Plateau United by 5pm on Saturday while Rivers United and Kwara United will be working unto perfection against Moroccan sides, Wydad Casablanca and RS Berkane respectively on Sunday. Nigerian journalist, Mike Emenyonu, noted that the clubs from the country have faced North African sides, both in the CAF Confederations Cup and Champions League \u2013 in the group stages and knockout \u2013 on 33 different occasions in the last seven seasons. However, it is only three times that any Nigerian side have secured the upper hand; representing a paltry 10per cent victory rate. Akwa United and Rangers are the Nigerian teams with the recent victories and the trio of Rivers United, Plateau United and Kwara United will hope to emulate the two clubs. Indeed, the stakes are high this weekend and just as the Nigerian clubs are desperate for favourable results, it will also be heartwarming for the country in its bid to maintain the same quota for the CAF inter-club event. Even though the first leg ended in slim victories for Rivers and Plateau United, it is not a mean feat . PREMIUM TIMES, in last weekend\u2019s preview, pointed out that both Esperance De Tunis and Wydad Casablanca have never lost to any Nigerian sides, despite playing away. The duo of Esperance and Wydad defeated Sunshine Stars and Lobi Stars respectively, on the road. Going into the first leg,   to a Tunisian side. However, the jinx was broken as Plateau United trolled past the visitors with a hard fought 2-1 victory in Nigeria to end Esperance\u2019s nine matches unbeaten run over a Nigerian club. The last time such an event occurred was in 1990 when Heartland defeated Esperance in 1990. According to  , some records were broken by the Nigerian clubs during the first leg of the encounter. \u2013 Kwara United are the first Nigerian club to score 3+ goals in consecutive home matches on the continent in a season since Rivers United in 2017.

Plateau United ended Esperance\u2019s nine matches unbeaten run against Nigerian clubs. It is a first victory by a Nigerian club against the Tunisian side since 1990 (Heartland 2-1 Esperance).

After losing their opening group game to Germany last Tuesday, the Busayo Olowokere-led Flamingos bounced back with a 4-0 victory over New Zealand on Friday in their second group game. Two first-half goals from Amina Bello\u2019s header and a well-curled shot from Miracle Usani gave the Flamingos a healthy lead before the victory was sealed with second-half strikes from the duo of Taiwo Afolabi and Etim Edidiong. Going into Friday\u2019s game, both Nigeria and New Zealand needed the match badly due to their   in their group openers against Germany and Chile, respectively. Coach Olowookere made two changes to the squad that lost to Germany with Amina Bello, who scored her debut goal starting ahead of Edidiong Etim and Bisola Mosaku for Mary Aderemi in a 4-4-2 formation. After both sides were evenly matched in the first 15 minutes of the game, Amina Bello put the Flamingos in front as she headed in Adeshina\u2019s cross. That opening goal was the catalyst the Flamingos needed as they stepped up with several goal attempts afterwards. Opeyemi Ajaikaye forced Aimee Danielle-Feinberg to a corner after the forward\u2019s trickery attempt was miscued by the goalkeeper. Bello, who broke the deadlock for the Nigerian ladies, failed to double the lead after her shot was saved by New Zealand Goalkeeper Aimee Danielle-Feinberg in the 20th minute. The combination between Bello and Adeshina wasn\u2019t enough to stretch Danielle four minutes later. The sustained pressure from the likes of Bello and Ajakaiye eventually paid off when Usani Miracle doubled the lead for the Flamingos with a screamer. Her left-corner outer shot went over both New Zealand\u2019s players, Manaia Elliot and Danielle in the 34th minute. It was the defender\u2019s second goal in the tournament, with the first coming from a free kick against Germany on Tuesday. The second half saw an improved performance from the New Zealand ladies as they checkmated the Flamingos\u2019 goal-scoring chances. However, after a string of missed chances, the Flamingos got the third goal, with Taiwo Afolabi scoring from a well-crafted outer shot in the 75th minute.
