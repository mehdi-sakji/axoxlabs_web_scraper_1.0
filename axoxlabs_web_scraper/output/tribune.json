This is just as it traced the challenges confronting the country to political and separatist tendencies and permutations in disregard for the country\u2019s interest. The MMWG, in a statement by its Ogun State coordinator, Alhaji Kamaldeen Akintunde, accused the political class of taking advantage of the country\u2019s diversity to promote selfish agenda and undermine the country\u2019s corporate existence. The group described cooperation, understanding, patriotism and the rule of law as a recipe for overcoming the myriad of problems facing the country. The MMWG decried the discordant tunes in government circles and the pursuit of selfish agenda by political, ethnic and religious leaders. It cautioned the leaders and their aides against making inflammatory statements capable of generating tension and disquiet under the guise of defending government actions and inaction. It enjoined the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) to exercise magnanimity on issues by exploring a more constructive engagement with critical stakeholders at proffering solutions to the country\u2019s challenges. The group emphasised a robust approach to dealing with the vexed issue of open grazing and canvassed for a holistic measure that could guarantee an enduring and sustainable peace. The MMWG also implored the Federal Government to address genuine concerns about restructuring as a way of ensuring a cohesive and united Nigeria and discourage the clamour for self-rule. It noted that the pluralism of the Nigerian state had made it compelling for political leaders to institute a system that would ensure even distribution of resources for an all-round development of the country. The group advocated the promotion of fairness, equity and justice in the allocation of resources and infrastructure to resolve issues undermining \u201cour survival as a nation.\u201d ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "news", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/stop-destabilising-nigeria-mmwg-warns-political-class/"},

Truss, Britain\u2019s third female prime minister, was unable to save her embattled premiership even though she ditched her entire economic plan and replaced two key Cabinet posts over the past week. \u201cI cannot deliver the mandate for which I have been elected by the Conservative Party. I spoke to the king and notified him that I was resigning,\u201d she said in front of her residence at Downing Street. Truss said that there would be a leadership election to replace her \u201cto be completed within the next week.\u201d She said that she would \u201cremain as prime minister until a successor has been chosen.\u201d The leadership election that ushered her into office took two months and involved multiple rounds of votes among Conservative Party lawmakers before two finalists competed for the support of the broader party faithful. An election completed within a week suggests dramatically truncating that process \u2014 and potentially narrowing the decision about who will lead the country to an even smaller set of people. A day after she told Parliament that she was a \u201cfighter, not a quitter,\u201d Truss met with the powerful chair of the 1922 committee, Graham Brady, who knows exactly how many Conservative lawmakers have issued letters of no confidence in her leadership. Truss has only been in the office for 44 days. The previous record-holder for the shortest-serving prime minister was George Canning, who lasted 119 days. He started on April 12, 1827, and died on Aug. 8, 1827. Under her leadership, the poll ratings for the Conservative Party have tanked. If there was an election today, the Conservatives would almost be annihilated. YouGov, the pollster, said that she was the most unpopular prime minister the organization has ever tracked. Truss came to office with a vision for a low-tax, small-government state. But her plans, which included billions of unfunded tax cuts, spooked the markets and sent the pound plunging. It wasn\u2019t long before she was forced to jettison her agenda and fire her chancellor. It was unclear who exactly would take over from Truss. Some commentators speculated that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor who many were calling the de facto prime minister, could be called on to be a caretaker leader. On Thursday morning at least 16 of Truss\u2019s own lawmakers went on the record calling for her to resign following a chaotic and confusing 24 hours, which saw claims of bullying in Parliament and the resignation of the home secretary. Among those was Conservative lawmaker Sir Gary Streeter who tweeted, \u201csadly, it seems we must change leader BUT even if the angel Gabriel now takes over, the Parliamentary Party has to urgently rediscover discipline, mutual respect and teamwork if we are to (i) govern the UK well and (ii) avoid slaughter at the next election.\u201d Simon Hoare, chairman of the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, told the BBC that the country has a \u201cgovernment that wants to function\u201d but conceded it was currently engaged in \u201chand-to-hand fighting.\u201d He said that he was a \u201cglass-half-full sort of person\u201d have believed the ship could be turned around. But he added that needed to happen quickly: \u201cI think there are about 12 hours to do it.\u201d In one impassioned interview Wednesday night, lawmaker Charles Walker spoke frankly about his frustrations. \u201cI\u2019m livid,\u201d he said. \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t say this, but I hope all those people who put Liz Truss in No. 10, I hope it was worth it \u2026 because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary.\u201d Labour leader Keir Starmer, who hasn\u2019t had to do much more than sitting back and watch his rivals implode, called for a general election \u201cnow.\u201d \u201cBritain cannot afford to the chaos of the Conservatives anymore, we need a general election now,\u201d he said Thursday.

Nigerian Tribune learnt that the free vaccination campaign, which took place at the Veterinary Clinic, Amawbia, on Wednesday, will go across the 21 local government areas of the state. Declaring the event open, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Foster Ihejiofor, said that the campaign is a global commitment to eliminate human deaths from dog rabies by 2030 in Anambra and beyond. The commissioner urged dog owners in the state to bring their dogs and cats for free vaccination. He further stated that the state\u2019s ministry of agriculture is collaborating with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to dispense the free vaccination of dogs and cats against rabies across the 181 communities in the state. Dr Ihejiofor warned dog owners in the state to monitor their dogs, noting that if any case of dog bites occurs, the owner of the dog will be charged to court for murder. In his address, the director, veterinary services, Dr Ideh Basil, said that despite the high fatality, the disease is 100 percent preventable through mass dog vaccination and enlightenment campaigns as dogs account for 99 percent of human deaths resulting from rabies. According to him, before now, the state government had been alone in the fight to eliminate the rabies virus in spite of the attendant huge cost through its annual vaccination campaign programme. He said the recent intervention by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development through procurement of vaccines to support the state governments in this fight against rabies is a welcome development. So far, he said the state had taken delivery of 3,500 doses, out of a total of 4,100 doses of the vaccine allocated to the state for this year\u2019s campaign.

The summit themed, \u201cwith patients, for patients\u201d, is an interactive panel discussion with the corporation\u2019s West Africa Country Manager, Olayinka Subair, and patients advocates in oncology, rare diseases and immunization who shared the impacts of their interventions to patients. According to Subair, the virtual event is aimed at learning from the corporation\u2019s patient advocacy partners to understand and better incorporate patient voices into our work every day.  He said, \u201cPfizer could not realize its purpose without the pivotal role played by patients, caregivers, and advocates either by engaging in Research and Development efforts, offering consult on clinical trial design, or by partnering with us to develop tools, resources, and easy-to-understand materials for our patients. \u201cThis time and focus will support our work as we continue to strive to be the most patient-centric company, understanding and embedding the patient perspective in all we do. Further, Pfizer will be able to develop more innovative medicines and breakthroughs when we engage with patients and patient advocacy groups to understand the needs of all patients. \u201cPatients in Focus spurs inspiration, energy, and innovation by showcasing examples of new ways to include patients at every step of Pfizer\u2019s work and is an opportunity for us to collectively envision how we can continue to best serve the evolving needs of patients in the years to come.\u201d Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Pfizer, Sally Susman, said the purpose of Pfizer is to develop breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. She said, \u201cFor our work to be meaningful, every function of Pfizer needs to understand the importance of engaging patients, caregivers, and advocates in our work. By showcasing real patient experiences and where we have made an impact on patients\u2019 lives, Patients in Focus week will continue to build empathy and show colleagues how to focus on patient advocacy year-round and in everything we do.\u201d In their separate submissions, Patient Advocates emphasized the impact of partnerships and importance of including patients\u2019 perspective in all facets of Pfizer\u2019s work. Vice President, Global Access Financing, Michelle Akande, said, \u201cPatients in Focus allows us to highlight examples of successful patient engagement and partnerships and learn from them, demonstrating not only how Pfizer has made a difference in patients\u2019 lives but how patient groups provide insights that guide our work. \u201cBy sharing real patient and caregiver experiences, Patients in Focus will build empathy for and allow colleagues to better understand patient journeys and how we can work with patients to address unmet needs.

The plaintiff pleaded with the court if her prayer was answered to grant her custody of their child but make him responsible for his upkeep.

Bisola said in court that: \u201cMy lord, if I knew that all I would get from my marriage to my husband was bitterness and woe, I wouldn\u2019t have ventured into it at all. \u201cIdowu from the outset of our marriage refused to take up his responsibility as head of the home. He passed the bulk of his duties to me. \u201cMy husband grew worse when I was delivered of our first and only child. He was always complaining of paucity of fund and again refused to be up to his responsibility towards our son. \u201cI enjoyed no peace at home and always dreaded going home after the day\u2019s activities. \u201cThe only thing that gave me joy in our marriage was our child whom I became dedicated to since my husband denied him the necessary care and attention. \u201cI took up the challenge of meeting the home\u2019s needs and became a food vendor. \u201cI became a household name in the community where I was trading and had more of opposite sex as my customer and my husband felt uncomfortable with this. \u201cHe became unapproachable at home and would always raise dust over trivial issues. At the end of the day he would beat me. \u201cMy lord, my husband \u2018s behaviour\u00a0 grew from bad to worse. He alleged that I was dating my customers and would come to my shop to fight me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t stop at this. Idowu destroyed my property in the shop and put my business on hold. \u201cI moved out of his\u00a0 house when it appeared there would be no end to his maltreatment of me and our child. He obviously wanted to kill me. \u201cMy husband kept bragging and threatening me on the telephone that he would send thugs after me if I refused to return our son to him. \u201cMy lord, I am tired of my husband\u2019s unruly\u00a0 behaviour.

The stage came alive when Oba (Dr) Adedapo Tejuoso through his Oba Karunwi III Evangelical Movement (OKTEM), led other traditional fathers into God\u2019s presence with praises and thanksgiving. The event, which was the 19th edition, also marked the first anniversary of Oba Tejuoso\u2019s inauguration as the grand patron of the African Church Worldwide. Gospel ministers who ushered in the traditional fathers, clerics and dignitaries included music legend, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey-Fabiyi, who also doubled as the chairman on the occasion; Evangelist Funmi Aragbaye; Evangelist Bukola Akinade (Senwele Jesu); Akin Jiboke; Divine Sisters; Ayan Jesu, and Aduke Gold, among others. The venue was filled with intense praise as traditional fathers from various states\u00a0 dazzled other guests as they rendered praises to God. The event did not go without supplications to God over the nation, Ogun State, the state governor, royal fathers and the various kingdoms represented. According to the convener, Oba Tejusoso, it was another time to come before God in unity to sing praises to Him, noting that, \u201cthe Lord is good and His mercies endureth forever. Therefore, let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. God has been good to us. He has been faithful and He has proven Himself to be the one true King of kings and the Lord of lords.\u201d Speaking about the programme, Oba Tejuoso noted that, \u201cGod has been the sustainer of the event since 2004 and the 19th edition of the royal gathering is an indication of His habitation in our midst. The annual kings, queens, princes, chiefs and men of God is done to praise and appreciate the creator of the universe, who our ultimate King for His love so tender, care, and protection. \u201cPastor E. A. Adeboye (my mentor who led me to Jesus Christ 30 years ago) once said that, how you approach a house will determine whether you will be welcomed or chased out. If you approach the door and knock, you will be attended to as a lady or gentleman, but if you break through the window, you will surely be taken for a burglar, thief or robber and met with severe resistance. Your approach matters! To enter into God\u2019s presence, you must follow heaven\u2019s protocol. \u201cHe deserves our thanksgiving, praise and worship for we are created just for that. Let us, therefore, join the 24 elders above to cast our crowns before the throne of grace and fall down to worship Him as this is our aspiration for eternity, God willing. Practice makes perfect.\u201d In his words, the chairman on the occasion, Evangelist Obey-Fabiyi, appreciated everyone including the royal fathers, clerics, and dignitaries who graced the event. \u201cDespite all that is happening around us, I believe we all have reasons to be indeed grateful to God. It is by His mercies that we have not been consumed. From Boko-Haram and Niger-Delta insurgency, kidnapping and banditry to the national economic recession, we are still very alive, hale and hearty. \u201cSo, with this, let us all put on our dancing shoes and lift up our hands in adoration to our God, even as we shower Him with encomiums that He alone deserves. For the Lord is good and His mercies endureth forever more. Without gainsaying, He deserves us to show our heartfelt appreciation unto the Lord for keeping us alive and healthy. As a matter of fact, our praises of today, will be an assurance and guarantee of God\u2019s guidance and protection to our country\u2019s democratic, security, and economic prowess,\u201d he added.

The group, in a communique at the end of a stakeholders summit held in Ibadan, Oyo State, emphasised the need for all citizens across the geographical divides to renew their loyalty and devotion to Nigeria and join hands with the Federal Government to find solutions to the challenges facing the country. PAG, in the communique signed by its chairman, Malam Abdul-Waheed Olowonjaye and the summit chairman, Dr Suleiman Adediran, implored Nigerians to work for the progress of the country, stressing that the nation should remain one indivisible entity and its unity should not be negotiable. The group said Nigerians should intensify prayers to rescue the country from elements that are hell-bent on destabilising the country. PAG described good governance, equity and justice as essential ingredients for security, peace and progress of the country and urged political officeholders to see their positions as a trust, for which they would be held accountable by man and God. As the 2023 general election gathers momentum, PAG urged the electorate to increase their awareness so as to be able to distinguish between dubious politicians and those who are genuinely interested in the development of the masses and the country. The group reiterated its determination to support individuals that share its agenda for good governance and are eyeing positions in the next political dispensation. It said it supported the ongoing process to review the 1999 Constitution but warned against any attempt to alienate the Shariah law from the constitution. During the opening session of the summit, the lead speaker, Professor Afis Oladosu, the Dean, Faculty of Arts, University of Ibadan, said Nigerians needed to embark on moral rejuvenation to reduce corruption in the land and make the country work for all and sundry. Professor Oladosu, who argued that God-conscious persons would not engage in corrupt practices, said: \u201cThe destiny of Muslims in Nigeria is hinged on the destiny of Nigeria. We can\u2019t but find ways to ensure that we all work towards the good governance that we desire. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that if we stand aside from the political process. Those who are in government should rise up to their responsibilities. They should remember the promises they made to Nigerians before they were elected. They should stop benchmarking their prosperity against the adversity of the populace.\u201d In a remark, a former governor of Oyo State, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, underscored the need to uphold the unity of Nigeria, warning against secession as being advocated in some quarters. Senator Ladoja, who was represented by a former Secretary to the Oyo State Government, Chief Sharafadeen Alli, decried the idea of tagging a particular ethnic group as criminals, maintaining that every tribe has bad eggs and criminal elements. The former governor posited that the practice of true federalism would solve the series of challenges facing the country.

The PFN president, Bishop Francis Wale Oke, had warned the Senate to reject a memo presented during the ongoing public hearing on constitution review by The Muslim Congress (TMC) seeking the introduction of Sharia law in the South West. NACOMYO, in a reaction through a statement signed by its national president, Malam Sani Suleiman Maigoro and national secretary general, Alhaji Mas\u2019ud Akintola, said: \u201cWe know the reasons for the bishop\u2019s Shariaphobic stance. However, we want to allay his fears that what we are agitating for now is giving effect to what we have been living with for ages, i.e., family inheritance, civil matters among Muslims, marriage contracts, etc, and not the criminal aspect which requires applying sanctions on offenders. \u201cThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution provides a platform for the various interest groups to ventilate their opinions. Why would PFN, instead of demanding for canon law, urge the Senate not to listen to the Muslims? We wish to caution them to desist from their Islamophobic tendencies.\u201d On its part, the MSSN B-Zone, which covers the southern part of the country, described the PFN\u2019s position as unfortunate, parochial and unconstitutional. In a statement by its president, Qaasim Odedeji; secretary, Abdul-Jalill Abdur-Razaq and Public Relations Officer, Mos\u2019ud Tohir, the MSSN asked the PFN to exhibit a sense of responsibility and work for the peaceful coexistence of all Nigerians. The statement reads in part: \u201cPerhaps the PFN does not know that the constitution of any nation does not merely reflect its cultural, social and political worldview, but also, to a large extent, is a representation of its religious inclinations, precepts and beliefs. \u201cThis may explain why the Nigerian constitution, with its Anglophone Christian origin, has inclined towards the Christian faith than any other religious sensibility in the country. \u201cShariah has always been in the constitution and the establishment of Sharia court anywhere in Nigeria where there are Muslims is legal and constitutional. The agitation of Muslims for the establishment of Sharia courts in the South West is only to give effect to the constitutional requirement for it. \u201cIn fact, the government should not even have waited for Muslim agitation before doing the normal thing. Nigeria is a multi-religious country not a secular country without regard for religions. \u201cThe position of the PFN is not only unconstitutional but it is uncalled-for, unfortunate and parochial. The PFN should exhibit a sense of responsibility and work for the peaceful coexistence of all Nigerians.\u201d ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "news", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/nacomyo-mssn-fault-pfns-position-on-proposed-shariah-law-in-s-west/"},

Quoting from Psalm 34 vs 3-5, and Psalm 118, Odedeji noted that cultivating the attitude of gratitude was imperative. \u201cWe are here today at the 25th anniversary of Dowen College to praise and give gratitude to God for helping the school reach this milestone. \u201cThe school has moulded character and touched lives, this is a service of thanksgiving and gratitude to God. \u201cIt is a service of acknowledging God for what he has done for the school.

{"headline": "Could junk food lead to poor eye health with age", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/eyesight.jpg", "author": "", "posted_date": "Feb 6, 2020", "description": "Aim to fill your plate with fruit, dairy, poultry, fish, and vegetables\u2014instead of processed and fried foods\u2014research suggests. According to a new study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, eating an unhealthy diet full of processed meat, fried foods, and high-sugar items over a long period of time can lead to eventual vision loss. Instead, aim to fill your plate with fruit, dairy, poultry, fish, and vegetables\u2014which are not only beneficial to your eyes, but your heart and brain as well. Thanks to new research, \u201cwatch what you eat\u201d may take on a whole new meaning. A study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology suggests that eating a \u201cWestern pattern diet\u201d\u2014which includes processed meat, fried foods, and high-sugar items\u2014may present significant risks for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of irreversible vision loss among older individuals worldwide. Researchers looked at data from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities\u2014a population-based epidemiological study with nearly 16,000 participants reporting on lifestyle habits and medical histories from 1987 to 2017\u2014and compared food questionnaires to retinal photographs taken at two different points in that 30-year time frame. Their findings? Those who ate a Western pattern diet had a threefold higher incidence of late AMD compared to those whose diets leaned more heavily on fruit, dairy, poultry, fish, and vegetables\u2014particularly dark leafy greens and carotene-rich options. Although the risk for early AMD was not significant in the results, study coauthor Amy Millen, Ph.D., of The State University of New York, Buffalo\u2019s School of Public Health and Health Professions, said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s still a connection there, particularly if this type of issue runs in your family. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that early AMD risk is influenced more by genetics than diet, and that diet can influence the direction the disease goes, and whether it advances or not,\u201d she told Runner\u2019s World. Although eggs are part of a Western pattern diet, that\u2019s one food that needs more research to determine its effects on vision, according to Millen. Eggs are a good source of lutein, she said, which has been shown to be a beneficial nutrient for the eyes. But bologna and potato chips? There\u2019s no debate there. \u201cFoods that are part of the Western diet are less nutrient dense, meaning they provide less of the beneficial nutrients needed for the eyes per calorie contents than such food as fruits and vegetables,\u201d said Millen. She added that these foods also tend to increase weight and systemic inflammation\u2014two more risk factors for AMD.

{"headline": "Is eating more plant-based foods the secret to eye health?", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Vegetables.jpg", "author": "", "posted_date": "Feb 6, 2020", "description": "THERE are a few spots in the body better designed than others. The skull is pretty good. Opposable thumbs are amazingly useful. But knees could use an overhaul, perhaps. And eyes? They\u2019re often in need of support before we\u2019re old enough to read. But can a diet rich in plants help with eye health? A little anecdote here: When I was in the first grade, I wore glasses. Not just any old glasses\u2014bifocals, just like my grandmother. I had weird stuff going on like being near- and far-sighted at the same time, apparently. Everyone in the family wore glasses so it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. But then, I lost them. (They were actually stolen and stepped on by Jimmy Berman\u2019s friend Steve when we were having a little fight on the playground. Six-year-old romance is complicated. But as far as my parents were concerned, I lost them, okay?) So, back to the optometrist, we went for a new prescription. Except, this time, he said I didn\u2019t need them. It\u2019s not uncommon for sight to change, especially in a child. But to go from bifocals to eyeglass-free was unexpected. The doctor said that by high school my poor sight would return and I\u2019d need glasses again. That didn\u2019t happen. And now, some, ahem, thirty years since high school, and I\u2019m still 20/20\u2014even after sitting at a computer all day while everyone else is my family wears glasses. The biggest difference between me and the rest of my family? I went vegan shortly after high school. And I didn\u2019t just give up animal products, I went deep into \u201chippy food\u201d territory\u2014carrot juice and steamed kale were daily feasts. And it turns out they may have done my still-developing eyes a whole world of good. Does diet affect eye health? Not only do \u201ceye-healthy\u201d foods like beta-carotene-rich carrots and sweet potatoes and dark leafy greens like kale help improve eyesight, but a poor diet can make eyesight worse, faster. New findings published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology suggest the standard American diet, which is heavy in processed meat, fried foods, and sugar, can increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration. According to the study, a standard meat-heavy diet increased the risk of macular degeneration by three-fold over healthier diets. Those who ate more fruits and vegetables (the study also included eating poultry, fish, and dairy in that subset) saw a decreased raisk. That decreased risk came with higher consumption of carrots and greens. \u201cFoods that are part of the Western diet are less nutrient-dense, meaning they provide less of the beneficial nutrients needed for the eyes per calorie contents than such food as fruits and vegetables,\u201d study coauthor Amy Millen, Ph.D., of The State University of New York, Buffalo\u2019s School of Public Health and Health Professions, said in an interview. And she pointed to another correlation: inflammation. Foods generally considered unhealthy\u2014that Standard American Diet, once again\u2014don\u2019t just affect our weight or risk for heart disease or cancer. According to Millen, like all things, diet is connected to our eye health. \u201cMost people understand that diet influences cardiovascular disease risk, and risk for obesity, but I\u2019m not sure how much the average person thinks about diet as connected to vision loss,\u201d said Millen. \u201cBut what you eat to maintain good health is also related to what you eat to maintain good vision.\u201d  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "health", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/is-eating-more-plant-based-foods-the-secret-to-eye-health/"},

{"headline": "Five characteristics of highly impactful leaders", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/business-coach-new.jpg", "author": "Jonathan H. Westover", "posted_date": "Oct 10, 2022", "description": "AS I think about those leaders who have had the most lasting impact on my life, I am reminded that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to being a successful leader. Leadership styles and approaches often vary widely across organizational types and sizes, industries and sectors. Additionally, being a successful leader in one context doesn\u2019t necessarily translate over to being successful in another. However, the most impactful leaders in my life tend to share many common traits and characteristics. While not an answer for all of the complexities and challenges you will face as a leader, developing skills in and applying the following characteristics and competencies will help to drive your success and make you an unforgettable leader to your people:  Practice emotional agility Impactful leaders need to develop and practice emotional agility. In a recent Harvard Business Review article, the authors state, \u201cEffective leaders don\u2019t buy into or try to suppress their inner experiences. Instead they approach them in a mindful, values-driven, and productive way \u2014 developing what we call emotional agility. In our complex, fast-changing knowledge economy, this ability to manage one\u2019s thoughts and feelings is essential to business success.\u201d Indeed, if we hope to effectively connect with and lead our people, we need to first understand and be clear-minded about our own inner workings: what drives us, how do we respond to stressors, what situations bring out our best (and worst), how do we prefer to lead and how do we like to be led? As we better understand these and other aspects of ourselves, we can more effectively practice self-care. Additionally, we will be better equipped to practice emotional agility and be in a position to show genuine empathy and better understand and support our people.  Create a clear meaning and purpose Impactful leaders need to create a clear meaning and purpose for their people. In a recent Forbes interview with Wendy Ulrich, co-author of The Why of Work, Dr. Ulrich states, \u201cPeople find meaning when they see a clear connection between what they highly value and what they spend time doing. That connection is not always obvious, however. Leaders are in a great position to articulate the values a company is trying to enact and to shape the story of how today\u2019s work connects with those values. This means sharing stories of how the company is making a difference for good in the lives of real people, including customers, employees, and communities.\u201d As leaders (of both the formal and informal variety), we have the opportunity and responsibility to connect our people to the organization and team\u2019s values and ensure an alignment that will allow for them to find their meaning and purpose in their own work. This will drive higher levels of sustainable motivation, innovation and overall performance levels.  Practice systems thinking Impactful leaders need to practice systems thinking and help their people to see the connections between disparate functions and activities, as they align with the organization\u2019s vision and mission. In my recent Forbes article, I argued, \u201cContemporary businesses operate in ecosystems full of interconnectedness and constant feedback loops. Mapping such complex systems helps organizational leaders navigate into adaptive strategies. The ultimate gain is the ability of organizations to be responsive to the changes in ecosystems and to be prepared to fine-tune and adapt parts of their organization on the fly.\u201d As leaders, we see the big picture and need to help our people understand how the work they are doing in their functional area connects to the overall organizational strategy, the company\u2019s competitive advantage and the work of their colleagues. As you model systems thinking, you will help your people to become systems thinkers and integrative problem-solvers and innovators.  Practice openness and transparency Once you practice emotional agility, create a clear meaning and purpose and foster systems thinking in your team, it is paramount that you create and maintain a culture of openness and transparency. In an Entrepreneur article, the author states, \u201cTransparent leadership allows employees to be more honest about their individual viewpoints and more open about expressing them in a public dialogue. The more openness and honesty you facilitate in the context of your team, the faster you\u2019ll be able to work together to achieve a common end goal.\u201d High-impact leaders don\u2019t horde information to wield their power; rather, they become a hub for information and communication flow. As you help to facilitate an open and transparent environment, you will develop greater trust, and your people and team will thrive. Authentically care Finally, impactful leaders need to authentically care about their people. In a recent Forbes article, Dede Henley suggests, \u201cWhen people feel safe in their work environment, when they feel that it\u2019s safe for them to show up and fully be themselves, they\u2019re more productive. They know it\u2019s OK for them to bring their concerns, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their creativity to their job.\u201d You can\u2019t fake authenticity, and your people will see through you a mile away if you are not sincere. But as you authentically care, your people will feel supported and empowered, enabled to be their whole and best self. Conclusion Leaders are increasingly faced with amplified organizational complexity and a myriad of challenges as they strive to help their organizations develop, maintain and grow their competitive advantage. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to becoming an impactful leader. Growing into a leadership role requires conscientiousness and self-reflection. Of course, you need to learn about the intricacies of your organization, but more importantly, you need to learn about your people, authentically care and openly communicate. Connect them and their work to meaning and purpose, and everyone will thrive.

The National President of the association, Mrs. Mary Afan made the call on behalf of other women farmers during a \u2018Public Dialogue on Gender-Responsive Agriculture Policy\u2019, organised by SWOFON and the International Budget Partnership. Afan observed the need for inclusion of women farmers in national budgeting processes and implementation to boost food security and production. The SWOFON president pointed out that most women farmers in Nigeria still use obsolete equipment on their farms, while the number of those who depend on Nigerian farmers for food is increasing. According to her, the need to mechanise farms has become imperative, noting that socio-economic effects of insecurity and flooding across the country had led to reduction in crop yields and income for women farmers. On his part, Country Manager, International Budget Partnership, Mr. Austin Ndiokwelu, informed that agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), being the second-highest contributor in the country. Also, Lead Director, Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), Mr. Eze Onyekpere, said small scale women farmers make up 60 per cent of the farming population in Nigeria and produce 70 per cent of food consumed nationally.

{"headline": "Investigations into building collapse are not  waste of time \u2014Ayinde", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AYINDE-1.jpg", "author": "Dayo Ayeyemi | Lagos", "posted_date": "Oct 18, 2022", "description": "Contrary to certain opinion from the general public, the President of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr Olutoyin Ayinde, has said that investigations into causes of frequent building collapse in the country cannot be regarded as a waste of time. Speaking with the Nigerian Tribune in an exclusive interview in Lagos, the number one town planner in the country explained that every investigation is aimed at getting to the root of the matter. According to him, the processes and various strategies adopted for any investigation on building collapse have become case studies, pointing out that investigation is like conducting a study. \u00abThere is usually something that comes out of the study. You may decide not to make use of it,\u00bb he said. Ayinde\u203as response became imperative following different opinions about various panels of investigations/enquires set up by successive governments and professional bodies to unravel the cause of frequent building collapse in the country with the aim of preventing further occurrence. Nigerian Tribune gathered that despite various reports and recommendations of investigation panels on how to halt the menace, buildings have not stopped to collapse in most Nigerian cities. This singular issue has made citizens begin to see the setting up of panels of investigations as a waste of time and government\u203as resources. However, Ayinde, who was the Chairman of Investigation Panel into the 21-storey building collapse in Ikoyi, has this to say: \u00abinvestigations are not waste of time. Every investigation tries to get to the root of the problem. They are not entirely a waste. \u00abAs a matter of fact, students in construction should be made to watch those investigations live so that they can learn from other experienced professionals how to go about investigating things like this. \u00abThe process and various strategies is a case study on its own. Investigation is like conducting a study. There is usually something that comes out of the study, you may decide not to make use of it.\u00bb On lack of implementation of outcomes/recommendations of the investigation panels by the government, Ayinde said that nobody saw any of the report or the White Paper published. Lack of publication of the report, he said has made it difficult to really ascertain the recommendations of the report or what the white paper is doing. He said: \u00abFor example, the Tribunal that I chaired, there were 28 recommendations. Those 28 recommendations were not published. Then the White Paper agreed and adopted 26 of the recommendations. Again, those 26 were not published. The White Paper rejected two and those two were not published. So when there is no publication of a report, the recommendations and what was adopted, it makes it a little bit difficult to monitor our progress. \u00abIt is difficult for us to know whether we are making progress or not. So it\u2019s not about the number of panels now. I think we have too many panels. Various institutes and various professionals have adduced reasons; people have been given the benefits during their doctoral research and master degree research on building collapse, we should have solved it. \u00abSo if we have not solved it, the reason can only be human. It\u2019s not divine nor spiritual, it can only be human, and until we decide to take the bull by the horn to address it, we won\u203at be able to solve it,\u00bb Ayinde said. On flagrant disregard for government\u203as notices by developers and homebuilders,\u00a0 Ayinde, a former Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development in Lagos State,\u00a0 is of the opinion that anyone that\u00a0 continue work when notices have been served has just declared a war between him and the authority. And when such occurrence becomes frequent, he described it as a weakness of people in government. He said \u00abThis is weakness. It is not government.\u00a0 It is the people in government. Government is not an inanimate subject. Government is made up of human beings and everybody has a role to play. There are times people see the governor as a government, No! The governor is also playing a role in government. In fact, he is not supposed to be concerned with the issue like building collapse because there are people who are trained to do that. \u00abUnfortunately, when a thing like this happens in any state for that matter, the buck stops on the table of the governor. But the truth is that government is a system. It\u2019s a mechanism that has various parts. So when you say a site has been given notices and work continues, it is the failure of the system. Somebody is helping the system to fail; somebody is not doing his work right and, at the top, they may not know he is doing his work right until building collapse happens.\u00bb According to him, it should never be said that government served notices and someone else unsealed it.

He emphasised that the main suit relating to the controversial land is yet to be determined by the court and it is in the interest of justice that parties should maintain status-quo antebellum as ordered by the court. According to him, instead of the state government to adhere to democratic principle and obey the order of the court, he mobilised the state task force led by CSP Shola Jejeloye\u00a0to the site in gross violation of court order. It will be recalled that Justice Olukayode Ogunjobi of a Lagos State High Court sitting at TBS had ordered parties in respect of disputed land at Lagoon View Development Scheme (Oju Olokun), Chevron Drive in Eti Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State, to maintain a status-quo antebellum pending determination of the suit. The judge further ordered that all construction on the disputed land measuring about 101.673 hectares should be stopped and the defence parties should appear before the court to show why it should not grant all reliefs sought by the claimants. Justice Ogunjobi\u2019s order was sequel to an application of ex-parte dated February 22, 2022, filed before the court on behalf of Alhaji Shehu Adio Kassim Lumosa, and others, against the Lagos State Government and others. Respondents listed in the suit include the State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, State Land Bureau, Lagos State Development and Property Corporation Limited (LSDPC). Other respondents are First Bank of Nigeria, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited, NNPC, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria, AMCON, Ontario Oil and Gas Limited, Suntrust Savings and Loans Limited. While appearing before the court on the memorandum of claims against the respondents in respect of the property which forms part of the Estate of Madam Iyalode Efunloye Tinubu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Dr Dada Awosika, urged the court to grant the ex-parte application in the interest of justice. Dr Awosika informed the court that his application is supported by 51 paragraph affidavit, exhibits and written address to show cause why the applications should be granted. The parties were not present in court and didn\u2019t have a legal representation despite proof that they were served was tendered before the court. In his ruling, Justice Ogunjobi stated that having considered the depositions in the affidavit in support where the claimants averred that the eleven respondents have concluded arrangements to unjustly and illegally take possession of the disputed land, the court would grant the ex-parte. It would be recalled that the disputed land formed part of land which Adam Akinfolabi Akindele of Adamakin Investment and Works Limited were entrusted with as the Attorney of the Estate of Madam Iyalode Efunroye Tinubu.

Figures from the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development on October 16, 2022 put the number of those killed at 603. Further statistics from the ministry says that 1,302,589 people were displaced; 2,407 people injured, 603 people dead; 121,318 houses partially damaged; 82,053 houses totally damaged; 108,392 farmlands partially damaged while 332,327 farmlands totally damaged. What makes all this news sadder is that it was preventable, experts have noted.  Nothing strange about floods Floods are not strange to the earth. From Biblical times, floods have existed. What readily comes to mind is the flood of Noah. But like Noah\u2019s flood in the Bible, the current flood that has ravaged thousands of farmlands and displaced millions of people came with a prior warning.  A warning not heeded In mid-September this year, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) issued a warning that up to 13 states in Nigeria would experience flooding. The Director-General of NEMA, Mustapha Ahmed, said the following states would be flooded. They are Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Niger, Nasarawa, Kebbi, Kogi, Edo, Delta, Anambra, Cross River, Rivers and Bayelsa. Speaking on September 19, he said Nigerians should expect Kainji, Shiroro and Jebba dams located in Nigeria to overflow between then and the end of October. He then added that the situation would worsen with the release of excess water from the Lagdo dam in the Republic of Cameroon. He explained that \u201cBased on our communication with the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), the Lagdo dam operators in the Republic of Cameroon have commenced the release of excess water from the reservoir by 13th September 2022.\u201d \u201cWe are aware that the released water cascades down to Nigeria through River Benue and its tributaries thereby inundating communities that have already been impacted by heavy precipitation. \u201cThe released water complicates the situation further downstream as Nigeria\u2019s inland reservoirs including Kainji, Jebba, and Shiroro are also expected to overflow between now and October ending according to NIHSA. \u201cAccording to NIHSA, Kainji and Jebba dams have already started spilling excess water from their reservoirs. \u201cThis will have serious consequences on frontline States and communities along the courses of rivers Niger and Benue.\u201d In August, it was the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) that warned about imminent flooding in parts of Kaduna, Borno, Delta and Bayelsa states between then and October, 2022. And just as it was in the story of Noah\u2019s flood, NEMA\u2019s warning may have fallen on deaf ears of authorities in government. This is evidenced by the catastrophe expereinced by those affected Nigerians by the floods. \u2018Emergency measures should have been taken\u2019 \u201cRain monitors warned that there would be too much rain this year,\u201d said Professor Emmanuel Ofoezie, a professor of Environmental Management, and head of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Studies, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. \u201cCameroon is bound to discharge water from their dams when the water in the dam goes beyond safe levels. That is the best practice everywhere in the world,\u201d he said referring to the release of water from Lagdo Dam which has been fingered to be the cause of the current flood. This means that the current flood in Nigeria was not an ill-intentioned act by its eastern neighbouring country. The professor noted that had the dam broken because water was not released, the flooding would be worse. He added that, \u201cWe had this ill luck this year that it appears that the sea level is high. If the sea level is high, the sea will not take in any more water. When the sea level is high and the river level is high, the only option is to overflow onto the land. \u201cFor the flood areas there is nothing anyone can do than to wait for the flood waters to dry up. Luckily we are coming to the end of the rainy season. Ofoezie said that with warning coming its own agencies government ought to have taken definite emergency measures. \u201cNigeria should have taken emergency measures, because NIMET issued a warning followed by NIHSA earlier this year. NIHSA is in charge of hydrology \u2013 underground water supply and rivers while NIMET deals with the atmoosphere. They both issued warnings and specifically mentioned states that will be affected. \u201cThis flood met every one unprepared. Government was supposed have prepared for those that would be affected. Give them warning to leave; prepare where they would go \u2013 months before the flood came! What has happened is a shame. Both states and Federal Government were supposed to have prepared for these victims long before the flood caught up with them in their houses. It is not that they did not know! \u201cWhat they are doing now is resettling people in schools. Where will children go to learn?\u201d  A failure in agreement The Cameroonian dam in focus is called Lagdo dam. It is now notorious as the source of the recent flood. However, it has been reported that following the completion of the Lagdo dam in 1982, the Nigerian government, according to an agreement, was to embark on a similar project along River Benue. The purpose of the proposed dam was to contain the flood water released upstream from Lagdo Dam and prevent flooding and destruction of property and loss of lives. It was to be located in Dasin Village of Fufore Local Government Area of Adamawa State. The Federal Government has failed to construct this dam, hence the flood.  Other prevention measures \u201cSince 2005 or thereabout, Nigeria has been planning to build check dams along the Benue River. There are so many things we have suggested to the Federal Government of Nigeria \u2013 build safety dams, and you can even reflux the dry areas. \u201cThere is a way to channel the water that is coming. Using underground channels, you can direct water to dry areas that have been affected by climate change. \u201cAnd before you know it, you won\u2019t have any dry land in the North! \u201cThat is what they do in Israel that is a dry land and now looks like tropical Africa! We know what to do but won\u2019t do it.\u201d Dr Taiwo Hammed, an expert in Enviromental Management and Toxicology, suggested that a network of canals can be established from the river systems, which generally leads to floods. The lecturer in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Ibadan, also noted that reservoirs should be made for storing floodwater for example, artificial dams and canals should built along flood areas to help control the flooding, this also will provide water for irrigation of the farms especially during the dry season. A future warning amid climate change \u201cThis happened in 2012. It has happened in 2022. Let\u2019s see if they will be prepared in 2032, or will we still be caught unawares,\u201d Professor Ofoezie adds. \u201cThis flooding seems to be happening every 10 years. \u201cClimate change is not a joke. Even those who haven\u2019t heard of it hear it now. With climate change, it is not the weather you have this year that you will have next year. \u201cWe may have a near-drought situation next year and things like that! This year, we had early warning, sufficient for government to have prepared for the people that would be affected!\u201d ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "business", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/2022-floods-what-fg-could-have-done-to-avert-the-crisis/"},

The plight of the Okun Alfa community is exacerbated by the Eko Atlantic City real estate project promoted by the state and the $19 billion Dangote Refinery owned by Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man. In northern Cameroon, the Kakou and Ouro Garga communities struggle with climate change induced drought which has led to a decrease in agricultural yields and disruption of the agricultural calendars that existed for generations. In the two communities the cost of food has skyrocketed, forcing families to contend with poverty and malnutrition. In Togo, the Doevi Kope community, which had rich vegetation cover forests in the 1970S Is now seriously threatened by coastal erosion and coastal flooding. The impacts are worsened by the activities of Bollor\u00e9 Africa Logistics, the company that is currently constructing the Port of Lome. Eldorado and Katlehong communities in South Africa contend with incessant exposure to drought and heat waves that is now adversely affecting farming and leaving young people unemployed, desperate, and vulnerable.\u00a0 The report also recommends holding Big Polluters accountable for the climate crisis as well as concrete recommendations to government, civil society, and other critical interventionist agencies. The report was written by Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, African Centre for Advocacy, Gender CC South Africa, and Centre for Environmental Justice Togo with support from Corporate Accountability.

The experts made these calls at the\u00a0 Sustainability Media Capacity-Building\u00a0 Session, organized by Unilever Nigeria, recently in Lagos, recently. They argued that the nation\u2019s journalists must enhance their knowledge in that crucial subject in order to bring to the fore, issues relating to the subject. Speaking at the opening session of the\u00a0 two-day programme, the Director, Professional Education, School of Media and Communication, Pan-Atlantic University (PAU), Dr. Isaac-Ogugua Ezechuwku charged media practitioners on the need to develop and hone their skills, without necessarily waiting for sponsorships. He stated that the issue of sustainability, and how it affects individuals, brands and corporate organizations, requires the support of the media to be brought to the front burner. \u201cInterestingly, there is no way the media can successfully do this without embarking on self development projects that will enhance their knowledge in respect of this very important issue of how we develop as mankind. \u201cPractitioners should begin to think of how to invest in themselves, and sometimes save money to embark on studies that would, at the end, help them\u00a0 contribute their quota to\u00a0 germane issues, such as that of sustainability. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait for any sponsor to do that. While we acknowledge the fact that the industry could be tough, but practitioners should begin to cultivate the habit of investing in capacity development ventures such as\u00a0 this,\u201d he stated. He believes such trainings would go a long way in instilling confidence in the practitioner, and at the same time, boost productivity. Lead, Lagos Business School Sustainability Centre, Orevaoghene Irene Atanya, would want the media to do more on bringing the issue of sustainability to the front burner, by creating awards that use sustainability as the yardstick to measure performance. She also urged the media on the need to report with social impact in mind, translate researched solutions in to public information and embark on awareness campaign that would drive the narrative. Dr. Austin Nweze, also of the Lagos Business School, in his own contribution, urged media practitioners to pay attention to the environment and draw people\u2019s attention to it. He argued that while the economics of embarking on such such reporting may not be attractive, business-wise, he\u00a0 however\u00a0 recommended a project-based report, where brands and multi-nationals could sponsor. He also charged media practitioners on the need to focus on the implications of individuals\u2019, groups\u2019 and businesses\u2019 actions on the environment. In her contribution, the Director, Corporate Affairs and Sustainable\u00a0 Business at Unilever, West Africa, Soromidayo George, explained that the decision of Unilever to organize the event stemmed from the need to ensure that the issue of sustainability, and its impact on the environment is given the utmost attention it deserves. \u201cWhy sustainability matters to us is that it leads to less waste, less operational costs, while making us a responsible corporate organisation; hence the reason we are making it part of guiding principles at Unilever,\u201d she stated.

{"headline": "How to Be a Better Leader at Work", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/business-coach-new.jpg", "author": "Caroline Forsey", "posted_date": "Sep 26, 2022", "description": "Take a leadership assessment. The first step towards becoming a better leader is assessing your personal strengths and weaknesses to understand areas for improvement. Start by taking a leadership style quiz to determine which of the 8 leadership styles fits how you lead. Understanding your leadership style can help you determine how your direct reports view you, as well as the gaps that might exist in your current style. For instance, let\u2019s say you determine you\u2019re an autocratic leader. An autocratic leader doesn\u2019t ask for input from any team members before making a final decision \u2014 which can be ineffective, since it inhibits the leader from hearing different perspectives, and doesn\u2019t empower his or her employees. Once you\u2019ve determined this is your leadership style, you can work to actively request input from team members \u2014\u00a0 which enables employees to feel heard and empowered, while also helping you ensure you have all the information necessary before making a decision.  Be transparent and create open dialogue. Ultimately, transparency and honesty leads to a higher level of trust between team members and leaders, so remaining transparent with your direct reports is critical. Your direct reports want to know what\u2019s happening with the organization at-large, so taking the time to have direct, honest conversations with them about the company\u2019s goals is key. Good leaders are also excellent communicators. As Vice President of Blue Frog, Kelsey Halverson, told me, \u201cGood managers teach, great managers listen. A manager becomes a great teacher when he or she has a genuine desire to hear the organizations goals, challenges, and vision.\u201d Taking the time to tailor your communication style for each direct report goes a long way towards establishing strong relationships with them. To do this, ask each direct report to complete a DiSC assessment, which will help you better understand each team member\u2019s personality, how they respond to challenges, and how they prefer to communicate.  Foster deeper relationships with your team members Taking the time to learn who each of your team members is outside of work is vital for fostering a deeper relationship with them and establishing trust and understanding. Consider using icebreaker questions during team meetings, or creating opportunities for the team to bond outside of work. Additionally, ask your direct reports about their preferred way to work \u2014 including communication styles, how they like to receive feedback, and what their professional goals are. Finally, building rapport is about taking the time to get to know each direct report. In 1:1s, rather than jumping right into your meeting\u2019s agenda, consider beginning the conversation more naturally by asking about your direct report\u2019s weekend plans, or what she enjoys doing outside of work, all of which helps you both relate on a more human-to-human level.  Encourage professional development According to LinkedIn\u2019s 2019 Workforce Learning Report, 94% of employees say they would stay at a company longer if it simply invested in helping them learn. Providing your team members with learning and development opportunities can help you reduce turnover rates and increase employee engagement. Being a good leader is all about seeking out learning and development opportunities for your direct reports, encouraging them to learn, grow, and face new challenges. Additionally, it will help you make your team more successful in the long-run if you can help team members up-skill in certain areas, or nurture their own leadership skills as your team expands.  Show appreciation for a job well done Feeling recognized for a job well done can help boost an employee\u2019s morale, engagement, and productivity. For instance, consider the last time your boss gave you specific and positive feedback, such as, \u201cYou did a great job on your presentation on Tuesday. You gave fantastic context into the problem we\u2019re trying to solve on the team, and you were clear and articulate about your proposed solutions.\u201d Not only would that make you feel great, but I\u2019m willing to bet it would encourage you to work just as hard on your next presentation for more of that positive reinforcement. Remain creative and open-minded Good leaders are innovative, creative, and open-minded to new ideas or processes. Rather than adhering to the status quo, a good leader constantly looks for ways to streamline processes, create new opportunities for their team, and increase impact on the bottom-line. Good leadership includes taking a big-picture vision or strategy, and assigning specific tasks to individual team members to inspire, motivate, and challenge your team.

{"headline": "Guidance into great leadership", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/business-coach-new.jpg", "author": "Jeff Boss", "posted_date": "Oct 17, 2022", "description": "Professional development is critical to developing as a professional, and there are two pain points that leaders face when it comes to managing talent: engagement and retention. A recent study by Better Buys showed that employees are 15 per cent more engaged at work when there are professional development programmes available, and with higher engagement rates come higher productivity rates. If that little fun fact isn\u2019t fun about professional development and employee engagement isn\u2019t enough, here are three more: Why is this important? Because turnover prevents knowledge from being institutionalized and without a shared awareness about historical successes and failures there will be duplicative efforts and wasted costs. The takeaway: When engagement is lacking, professional development opportunities make a significant impact on retention. The single greatest challenge for CEOs in 2016, according to the Conference Board, is talent. Specifically, attaining, training and retaining top talent that keeps their company at the top of its game. After all, human capital is the fuel that drives organizations, and without the capacity to get ahead, your company falls behind\u2014 at best. It\u2019s no secret that when people have room to grow they\u2019re more likely to keep growing. Momentum has a funny way of continuing to evolve, and professional development is no different. There\u2019s a difference between being alone and being lonely. Having a little \u201cme\u201d time doesn\u2019t make you selfish. In fact, giving your brain time and space to think is exactly what keeps you at the innovative edge. The human brain is a muscle, and just like every other muscle in the body, it needs time to rest and recover. Sleep is one way, yes, but, just as you wouldn\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) eat all your fats (or carbs or proteins) for the day in one sitting, you shouldn\u2019t rely on sleep as the only time to give your brain a chance to recharge. Take five to 10 minutes during the day to sit back and think. All the research on meditation and mindfulness can\u2019t be wrong. Get away from \u2018me\u2019 and get into \u2018we\u2019. This means sharing knowledge so people have the opportunity to make decisions and act for themselves, thereby freeing up your time. I\u2019ve said before that nothing gets accomplished in this world without relationships, and you build relationships by focusing on how to help others. Ever noticed how it\u2019s easier to keep promises to other people but harder to keep them to yourself? It\u2019s much more tempting to hit the snooze button another seven or eight times despite telling yourself you wouldn\u2019t the night before. However, the best thing you can do to build character and personal integrity is to keep the promises you make to yourself. When you do this, others see it and they see you for who you are: a person of promise\u2013who delivers. And holding yourself accountable is the precursor to holding others accountable. People admire others whom they trust and respect, and when they see you holding yourself accountable then they\u2019re much more inclined to listen to you when you hold them accountable. Why? Because they know you wouldn\u2019t ask anything of them that you wouldn\u2019t ask of yourself. At the same time, when you hold others accountable they know where they stand with you. They know they need to either deliver or not deliver and be held accountable. Which one produces the results you want? Furthermore, accountability stems from clarity. Nobody has ever suffered from too much clarity. The inverse, however, is not true: a lack of clarity in the form of roles, responsibilities or expectations, for instance, creates unexpected change\u2014chaos\u2014which adds unnecessary gray hairs that we can all do without. Be precise in your language when you communicate. The who, what, when, where, why and how of the message are important, but equally critical is the language in which they\u2019re conveyed. When referencing the \u201cwhen\u201d component, for example, don\u2019t just say \u201c\u2026and we aim to accomplish [x] by the end of 2016.\u201d Be more specific. Are we talking calendar year? Fiscal year? What does \u201caccomplish\u201d look like? And does \u201caim\u201d mean \u201chope\u201d or is it a milestone that must be achieved? Clarity now saves confusion later. Remember that too much of any one thing is just that\u2014too much. Finding the right balance to dedicate the appropriate amount of time of each of the above is a learning process in itself.

{"headline": "NAMA sensitises key players on multilateration system", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nama2.jpg", "author": "Tribune Online", "posted_date": "Oct 20, 2022", "description": "In preparation of the implementation of the Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) Surveillance Air Traffic Management System in the Gulf of Guinea, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has held a two-day sensitisation workshop with stakeholders in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The workshop, which attracted participants such as airline operators, oil prospecting companies, the Nigerian Air Force, Nigerian Navy, NAMA engineers and air traffic controllers as well as other aviation agencies, was aimed at sensitising key stakeholders and regulatory authorities on the imperative of the project as well as the economic, security, operational and safety benefits accruable from its deployment and also extracting their buy-in and cooperation. Multilateration is a system that makes use of multiple remote sensors that pick signals from aircraft transponders and use them to determine the position of an aircraft by calculating the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) of the signals to the sensors. The system provides higher accuracy, greater update rates, better coverage and improved reliability at a much lower cost. Another key addition to the Multilateration system is the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) system to be used to provide surveillance for the monitoring and control of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or drones. While MLAT uses small unmanned ground stations placed strategically around an airport or terminal or remote locations to provide constant and automatic air traffic surveillance, like Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR), Multilateration is classified as a cooperative dependent surveillance system: the aircraft has to cooperate by switching on its onboard transponder. The workshop was an opportunity to also brainstorm and interact with the provider of the service, users of the service and key stakeholders in order to come up with an appropriate architecture for the airspace and also evolve a system that would be efficient, safe and economical to all parties. Speaking at the workshop, the Acting Managing Director of NAMA, Matthew Lawrence Pwajok, said the Multilateration project dated back to 2013 when a contract was awarded for the assessment of the traffic volume, complexity and architecture of the airspace in the Niger Delta, in view of the critical role of oil exploration in Nigeria and the crucial role of helicopter operations in support of oil exploration activities. Pwajok, who said the volume of helicopter operations in the Niger Delta had increased significantly within a very limited airspace bloc, given that helicopter operations were within very low altitude, said that the increased volume of flight operations, as well as airspace complexity, necessitated the quest for the provision of a dedicated communication, navigation and surveillance system for the safe, effective and efficient air traffic management of low-level helicopter operations in the Niger Delta Area of Nigeria in support of oil exploration activities. He said, \u201cThe density of their operations, the rising number of heliports, helipads, helidecks and landing platforms around the area became very critical. Helicopters were criss-crossing each other and the mode of control within the area had been procedural and by visual flight rules (VFR). The recommendation of the assessment team was that the traffic volume was beyond flight by visual flight rules and also beyond procedural control. \u201cWhat we currently have can no longer sustain increased flight operations or guarantee efficiency, safety and security of flight operations within the Niger Delta area, therefore the provision of an automated system of surveillance, monitoring and control of flight operations through Multilateration became imperative. Pwajok expressed gratitude to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) for providing the agency the location for the Multilateration centre in Port Harcourt to control and coordinate the surveillance of the entire area, stressing that the reconstruction of the Port Harcourt MLAT centre had been completed with power and cooling systems already installed while the installation of transmitters and receivers are ongoing in 29 sites to cover the entire Niger Delta area. The NAMA MD also hinted that ahead of its commissioning by the end of the year or early next year, critical milestones in the project such as factory acceptance test and factory training for air traffic engineers and air traffic controllers had already been done in Czechoslovakia, adding that the equipment had been shipped to the country while installations are ongoing. The NAMA boss listed the benefits of Multilateration to include: enhanced safety, efficiency and security of flight operations within the continental and oceanic airspace, just as he said it would enhance search and rescue in the oceanic airspace and aid the monitoring operation of ships as well as search and rescue of ships in distress within the maritime area.

Commenting on the development, the Managing Director of Centurion Security Services, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retired), wondered why such a huge amount was being budgeted at a time the country is preparing for elections. Ojikutu said, \u201cHere we go again; N36 billion for Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria\u2019s Airspace (TRACON) and Safe Tower in an election year. We need to seriously think of what we want to do about the sustainability of our aeronautical facilities and services within the global practices for flight operations or we just want to be spending and spending until we can not find money to spend again.\u201d He cited how in 2007, N8 billion was spent to buy and install the Safe Tower at Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt Airports and over $56 million spent separately on the same TRACON which was commissioned in 2012 just 10 years ago, which means the TRACON was only 10 years old. Ojikutu said, \u201cA lot of water went under the two projects which can wash a lot of people away in other climes. I was a member of the Safety Implementation Committee on NAMA, NIMET and NCAT and saw a lot in the manner the government\u2019s intervention funds were sourced and spent on the two aeronautical facilities that we are again budgeting N36 billion for in an election year and about 10 years ago, similar amount was spent. \u201cWe cannot be dolling out public funds into sectors that are supposed to be generating revenues without knowing how much these sectors are generating. Any sector that is not generating sufficient revenue to sustain its services and operations should be merged with a corresponding or relevant services provider.\u201d He however advised that if the government was still keen on giving out the federal airports for concessions, that only the non aeronautical services of these airports should be given out for concession while the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) must become a commercial holding company for the federal airports. \u201cThe aeronautical services, especially the runway, the taxiways and their associated lighting, should be handed over to NAMA and NAMA therefore should become a commercial company and should be able to execute any project within its revenue and resources. \u201cShould NAMA not have the financial capability to handle projects such as the TRACON and Safe Tower for sustaining its services, it should approach the bank or government for refundable or recoverable intervention funds and not the type of non refundable intervention funds we saw respectively in 2007 and 2012 for government agencies and private airlines,\u201d he said. Ojikutu argued further that those in administration of the aviation sector cannot faithfully say how much of these funds had been refunded today saying, \u201cPart of the funds is what AMCON is still sweating about on Aero and Arik. It is not clear what happened to the refund on the interventions given to FAAN, NAMA, NCAT and NIMET. \u201cStop this wastage of intervention funds on government agencies that have capacity to generate revenue or give them recoverable funds. Merge those that cannot sustain their services with their earnings with relevant agencies. We cannot continue to be giving unrecoverable funds as dash,\u201d he added.

Questions have also been asked as to why the immediate past government of the state was so much in a hurry to inaugurate an uncompleted project and why the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, would accept the commissioning of such an airport. The cargo airport project, which was started by the former governor, Ayodele Fayose, and taken over by the immediate past administration of Governor Kayode Fayemi, was inaugurated for public use after an Air Force aircraft landed at the airport. Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Aviation, who performed the inauguration, was among the dignitaries onboard the military aircraft which took off from Abuja and landed at the Ekiti Cargo Airport. The inauguration of the airport, which became a reality 10 years after the idea was first mooted, came at the end of the tenure of former Governor Fayemi. However, the manner the inauguration of the airport was conducted by the state government has elicited reactions from key players across the sector who doubted if the airport had been duly certified for operations by the statutory aviation agencies saddled with the responsibility of certifying a newly built airport for operations. According to the stakeholders, flight operations made into the cargo airport by a military aircraft instead of a cargo plane raised the question about the certification of the airport which they argued made it impossible for a commercial cargo flight to have been used to commission the airport during the inauguration. The stakeholders argued that for the regulatory agencies\u2019 officials to be absent at the inauguration raised the doubt about the completion of the airport before the rush to inaugurate it. While some defended that for the Minister to have inaugurated the cargo airport only pointed to the fact that the facilities at the airport were safe, secured and in total compliance with all requirements fit for operations, others have expressed reservations about the events surrounding the airport inauguration. Some of the stakeholders who faulted the use of a military plane to commission the airport wondered if the airport had actually been certified by the NCAA. Among the questions being raised include if the airport was certified by the NCAA; if the airport commissioning did not require certification and the presence of the certification authority; and why it was a military aircraft that was used as a test case for the commissioning of a cargo airport of Ekiti State. Another critical question being asked is if the airport had adequate operating insurance that would support commercial operations.

{"headline": "Moody\u2019s: Nine Nigerian banks\u2019 long-term ratings placed on review", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nigerian-banks-new.jpg", "author": "Chima Nwokoji  | Lagos", "posted_date": "Oct 17, 2022", "description": "Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s) has placed on review for downgrading the long-term deposit ratings, as well as long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings, where applicable, of nine Nigerian banks. They are: Access Bank Plc, Zenith Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, United Bank for Africa Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Limited, Union Bank of Nigeria plc, Fidelity Bank plc, FCMB (First City Monument Bank) Limited and Sterling Bank Plc. Moody\u2019s said its decision to place the long-term ratings of the nine banks on review for downgrade reflects the risk of increasing foreign currency rationing that could compromise the banks\u2019 operational ability to meet their foreign currency obligations, as well as the risk arising from a potential material depreciation in the country\u2019s foreign exchange rate to the banks\u2019 capitalisation and asset quality. According to the global rating agency, constraints on domestic oil production, capital outflows, and the increased cost of the country\u2019s imported refined petroleum products, coupled with US dollar strengthening, have together weighed on the availability of foreign currency liquidity in the country despite higher oil prices. It also expressed worry about material discrepancies between official and parallel market exchange rates that persist in the country. Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have declined to $38 billion as of September 2022 from $40 billion as of January 2022 despite higher oil prices, and \u201cwe understand that the Central Bank, which is the main provider of foreign exchange in the country, has consequently scaled down and become increasingly selective with its foreign currency allocations,\u201d it stated in a recent report. According to Moody\u2019s, the review for downgrade on the long-term ratings of Nigerian banks also captures the risk that a potential material depreciation in the country\u2019s foreign exchange rate could pose to the banks\u2019 capitalisation and asset quality. On average, around 40 per cent of loans extended by Moody\u2019s-rated Nigerian banks as of December 2021 were denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly dollars. Some of these borrowers are vulnerable to a further depreciation of the Naira because they do not earn foreign-currency income, and a weaker Naira would harm their repayment capacity. It said the banks\u2019 relatively high level of dollarisation also constrains the Central Bank\u2019s capacity to act as a lender of last resort in case of need. \u201cMoody\u2019s rating review will focus on assessing the banks\u2019 operational ability to meet their foreign currency obligations. \u201cThe rating review will take into account the expected evolution in foreign exchange reserves, as well as the various tools at the banks\u2019 disposal to conduct foreign currency\u00a0 payments amid reduced availability of US dollars. \u201cMoody\u2019s rating review will also assess the resilience of the banks\u2019 foreign currency liquidity positions and risk management frameworks amid ongoing foreign currency rationing in Nigeria and tightening funding conditions globally,\u201d the report read in part. Moody\u2019s rating review will also evaluate the resilience of the banks\u2019 balance sheets to a potential material depreciation in the country\u2019s foreign exchange rate. In particular, the rating agency review would assess the extent to which the banks\u2019 capitalisation buffers and foreign currency positions mitigate the risk from a potential material weakening in the local currency. The rating agency noted that in order to upgrade, the confirmation of the current ratings at the end of the review period could result from an assessment that: the banks have the operational ability to continue to meet their foreign currency obligations in case the foreign currency liquidity shortages were to continue for an extended period of time, and\u00a0 their balance sheets are resilient enough to withstand a potential material depreciation\u00a0 in the local currency in the context of a potential convergence of official and parallel market foreign currency exchange rates.

The bonds would be through N75 billion (a piece) for the 14.55 perc ent Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) April 2029, 12.50 per cent FGN April 2032, and 16.25 per cent FGN April 2037 re-openings. Similarly, some dealers expect activity in the money market to be muted in the absence of maturities, hence the direction of the true yield would be influenced by the auction result in the bond market. Meanwhile, the DMO says that Nigeria is not planning to restructure its debt. The clarification by the DMO was in reaction to recent reports by Bloomberg and other media platforms that the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said that the Federal Government was considering restructuring its debt and extending the repayment period of its credit obligations. This disclosure was contained in a statement issued by DMO on October 13, on its official Twitter account. The DMO, which had said that the Minister\u2019s statement was taken out of context, stated that Nigeria was exploring bond buyback and bond exchanges to manage its debt liability. The statement from DMO read, \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the recent report by Bloomberg attributing statements to the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning that Nigeria is planning to restructure its debt. \u201cWe wish to state that the Minister\u2019s statement was taken out of context. \u201cOver the years, Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy has always highlighted the need to utilise appropriate debt management tools to streamline the cost and risk profile in the debt portfolio. \u201cToward implementation of these strategies, Nigeria has typically availed itself of concessional loans, the spreading out of debt maturities to avoid bunching, and re-profiling of debt maturities by refinancing short-term debt using long-term debt instruments. \u201cAll of these, none of which constitute debt restructuring, are already being implemented. \u201cThe Nigerian government is also looking forward to exploring other appropriate debt liability management options such as \u201cbond- buy back\u201d and \u201cbond exchanges.\u201d \u201cWe want to assure local and international investors and creditors that Nigeria remains committed and will meet all its debt obligations.\u201d Recall that there were earlier reports on October 13, 2022, that the Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed, had, during an interview with Bloomberg TV, hinted at plans by the Federal Government to restructure Nigeria\u2019s debt with the extension of the repayment period of its loan facilities as the debt service burden rises. Ahmed, who said that the government has engaged the services of consultants for advice, noted that it plans to refinance domestic debt obligations that are due this year and next, while the country\u2019s N20 trillion ($45.4 billion) in outstanding borrowings from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would be converted into government bonds.

{"headline": "Banking staff strength down by 11.1% to 93,090 in Q4 2021 \u2014NBS", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nbs.jpg", "author": "Chima Nwokoji  | Lagos", "posted_date": "Oct 17, 2022", "description": "There are indications that total banking staff strength fell by 11.1 per cent between first quarter (Q1) and Q4 2021 to 93,090. This, according to the Q1-Q4 2021 Selected Banking Sector (SBS) data published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) last week, is attributed to a 7.6 per cent, 11.2 per cent, and 12.5 per cent reduction in senior, junior, and contract staff strengths. However, the report noted that the number of executive staff rose by 23.9 per cent to 249 over the period, though still below 0.5 per cent of the industry\u2019s total staff strength. Some financial experts from Lagos-based Afrinvest (West) Africa Limited said the situation might not be unconnected to the re-alignment in banking staff composition, which is a deliberate strategy targeted at optimising value amid growing challenges in the business environment. \u201cWe observed a strategic shift in banks\u2019 staff composition between 2018 and 2021. \u201cNotwithstanding, this is not a cheering development when considered from the perspective of job creation as Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate is already at a disturbing level (Q4:2020 unemployment rate: 33.3 per cent),\u201d the experts observed in an e-mailed note. Based on Afrinvest\u2019s analysis, the Nigerian banking sector rebounded strongly in 2021 from the pandemic shock the prior year, growing interest income on loans, net fee and commission income, and profit after tax (PAT) by 26.2 per cent (to N2.0 trillion), 59.2 per cent (to N713.2 billion), and 6.1 per cent (to N739.5 billion) sequentially as against 15.4 per cent, 18.2 per cent, and 16.3 per cent contractions in 2020. According to the analysts, this impressive performance resonates with the strong 10.5 per cent growth of the financial institutions\u2019 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2021, outperforming the broader economy by 710 basis points (bps). The NBS had disclosed that the total operating expenses of the banking industry surged by 22.3 per cent to N2.2 trillion in 2021. This momentum deviated from the 2019 (up by 3.3 per cent) and 2020 (down by 3.0 per cent) pattern, and industry watchers believe it is not unconnected to the surge in average inflation rate to 17.0 per cent from 11.4 per cent and 13.2 per cent in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In terms of credit disbursement to the private sector, total allocation surged by 244.5 percent to N267.1 trillion. Industry (37.1 per cent) and the services sector (36.8 per cent) accounted for a combined share of 73.9 per cent of the total disbursement, while government, trade and general commerce, agriculture, and construction received 9.2 per cent, 6.7 per cent, 5.4 per cent, and 4.8 per cent, respectively. Afrinvest noted that disbursement to oil & gas (49.5 per cent) and manufacturing (44.3 per cent) dominated credit allocation to the industry sector, while general services (25.8 per cent) and finance, insurance and capital market (17.5 per cent) received the chunk of flows to the services sector. In terms of payment channel performance, the e-channel accounted for 88.2 per cent and 97.7 per cent of the total volume and value of processed payments in 2021, relative to 92.7 per cent and 97.6 per cent in 2020. Of the e-channels, the internet/web transfers (40.2 per cent), POS (27.9 per cent), and ATM (15.2 per cent) accounted for the highest volume of transactions, while Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) transfers (55.3 per cent), internet/web transfers (27.6 per cent), and NEFT transfers (6.3 per cent) dominated in terms of value transacted.

{"headline": "Flour Mills of Nigeria: Looking beyond  Nigerian borders", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CF-PIX.jpg", "author": "SULAIMON OLANREWARJU", "posted_date": "May 10, 2022", "description": "With the approval granted Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) Plc by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Nigerian Exchange Limited and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria to acquire 71.69 per cent stake in Honeywell Flour Mills (HFM) Plc and 5.06 per cent stake of the company held by First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the coast is now clear for FMN to realise its vision of becoming the leading food and agro-allied group in Africa. Over the years, though FMN has demonstrated exemplary commitment to food security in Nigeria through its investments in agriculture, livestock feed and pasta manufacturing, it has always had its eyes on the continental market with a plan to become a giant in Africa\u2019s food and agro-allied industry. This, among other factors, propelled the Honeywell Flour Mills acquisition. The acquisition has revved up its production and marketing capacity and set the stage for FMN to become a continental powerhouse. Commenting on the approval of the regulatory bodies for the acquisition, Mr Boye Olusanya, Group Managing Director, FMN said, \u201cWe are delighted that approvals have been received and we are all set to begin execution of this landmark transaction that would positively impact Nigeria\u2019s food security architecture and overall competitiveness.\u201d He added, \u201cOur combined brands and businesses will mean an expansive scale of food production for both Nigeria and Africa. Together, Flour Mills of Nigeria and Honeywell Flour Mills will be able to achieve rapid growth while maintaining high-quality products serving the evolving needs of our consumers. The acquisition will further serve as a catalyst for an even stronger stream of innovation that is focused on local content offerings, enabling our customers across the nation to seamlessly benefit from improved access to a wider product range and a robust pan-Nigerian distribution network.\u201d Mr Olusanya\u2019s submission is in tandem with experts\u2019 views on the implications of the acquisition for the FMN Group. According to industry watchers, the acquisition of HFM by FMN will result in an enlarged customer base, solid market share and better channel penetration. It will also birth a strong combination of market-leading and diverse product offerings to the Nigerian population, thus strategically positioning the company for the opportunities available in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTFA). Experts also agree that the acquisition will foster an increase in shareholder value, stronger stream of innovation focused on local content offerings, increased geographical reach even beyond the shores of Nigeria and market share with additional customers and a diverse range of complementary product offerings to cater for the growing Nigerian population. It is also believed that the acquisition will streamline supply chain and operations of both entities on the back of economies of scale, savings from improved distribution and marketing channels, technology-enabled logistics to drive down operating expenses as well as enhanced productivity and efficiencies in back offices. In the near term, the HFM acquisition will propel FMN to unprecedented revenues of over a trillion naira. But beyond the benefits to FMN, analysts are of the opinion that the acquisition would impact positively on all major stakeholders. According to them, the acquisition will create in FMN a bigger and more resilient company with capacity to create more employment opportunities as well as ensuring long-term job preservation. Customers across the nation will benefit from access to a wider product range, an even stronger stream of innovation and a robust Pan-Nigerian distribution network; accessing greater number of points of sale supported by enhanced customer focused sales teams and redistribution capabilities. In their words, \u201cThe acquisition will increase scope to deliver product innovation to meet customers\u2019 needs.\u201d Similarly, the country will benefit from the acquisition as FMN\u2019s strategic plan focused on developing the agricultural value chain and backward integration of the food industry would ultimately improve food security. But while the benefits accruable from the acquisition of a majority stake in Honeywell Flour Mills are still in the realm of projection, the company has continued with the superlative performance that has become its trademark over the years as shown in its third quarter unaudited financial report released not too long ago. In that report, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc posted a growth of 51 per cent in Q3 and 49 per cent over a period of nine months. The growth was facilitated by the Group\u2019s unwavering commitment to continuous product innovation, improved capacity utilisation, creating good consumer experience, providing strong supply chain support and effective route to market strategies. In the third quarter of the current financial year, the FMN Group recorded N302.2 billion revenue, which is 51 per cent higher than the N200.2 billion recorded in Q3 of 2021. The gross profit posted in the period under review was N25.8 billion, a 17 per cent improvement over the N22.2 billion posted in the previous year. Operating profit for the quarter was N16.4 billion, a 40 per cent rise, while profit before tax for the quarter was N9.8 billion, an improvement of five per cent over the N9.3 billion figure for Q3 2021. Profit after tax for the quarter was N6.5 billion, a 10 per cent improvement over the N5.9 billion posted in the corresponding period of 2021. Similarly, the revenue for the nine-month period stood at N825 billion, this was 49 per cent higher than the N555.3 billion recorded for the same period in 2021. Gross profit for the period leapt by 11 per cent from the N72.4 billion recorded in 2021 to N80.2 billion for the period under review. In the same vein, operating profit rose by 14 per cent from N35.5 billion in 2021 to N40.4 billion in 2022. Profit after tax also moved up from N15.9 per cent in 2021 to N17 billion in 2022, an increase of seven per cent. The Group\u2019s Food Segment had a good showing during the period under review, posting an 18 per cent overall volume growth. The growth was bolstered by accelerated focus on the small pack size segment for the noodles category in order to increase affordability. Similarly, 22 additional vans with automated performance tracking tools were deployed to deepen the redistribution infrastructure drive. The segment was also actively involved in investments in redistribution resources while working closely with the dealers \u2013 vans, rural containers and tricycles. The Sugar Segment similarly recorded 20 per cent revenue growth. Although the segment\u2019s operating performance was largely impacted by the rise in raw material cost, the strategic move by the company resulted in a positive turnaround which had already started manifesting by the end of the quarter. In the period under review, the Agro-Allied Segment recorded a volume growth of nine per cent. This is made up of 48 per cent revenue growth in the Oil & Fats value chain, 21 per cent year-on-year volume growth in the Fertilizer business and 47 per cent growth in the animal feeds value chain. The Support Segment also put up a good performance recording significant revenue and profit growth driven by increased demand in Bagco, as well as the port business which performed well with top-line growth.Over the years, the FMN Group has demonstrated its capacity to create value for its customers, its shareholders and the society at large. As it embarks on a voyage of spreading the goodness of its products beyond the borders of Nigeria into other African countries, there is no doubt that this will engender higher returns on investment, improved shareholder value as well as the transformation of the national champion into a continental colossus.

{"headline": "OSH action checklist: Participants say training eye opening, impactful", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OSH-Launch.jpg", "author": "Christian Appolos | Abuja", "posted_date": "Oct 18, 2022", "description": "PARTICIPANTS at the just concluded Occupational Safety and Health Participatory Action-Oriented Training have said the training is impactful and advantageous to the growth and sustainability of their businesses. While they expressed gratitude to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and other partners who contributed to the success of the training, some of the participants who spoke to Nigerian Tribune said the training was an eye opener to how important safety and health tools, and the provision of necessary informative instructions in a workplace is to the overall wellbeing of workers, success and sustainability of a business. With the launching of the Action Checklist on Occupational Safety and Health in Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise in Nigeria, business owners in Nigeria now have a first hand instruction material on material storage and handling, workstation use of machines, electrical safety and fire prevention, work environment and control of hazardous chemicals, preventive measures to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases and welfare facilities and work organisation. Mrs Mary Adeleke, a fashion designer from Gombe, State said, \u201cWe were invited to a UNIDO-ILO programme. We were trained in different skills. The most important for me is Occupational Safety and Health (OSH). The OSH training is on how to ensure that our enterprises are equipped with tools to ensure the safety of our workplace and workforce. \u201cEmphasis was on the importance of ensuring the safety of our workers, the required tools we need for the purpose of providing safety and preventing accidents in our workplace. We were told to constantly improve on the necessary safety precautions we already have on the ground. Among the listed occupational safety and health tools we are asked to provide in our working place are; first aid box, fire extinguisher and we were taught to ensure that our facilities are highly ventilated. \u201cWe were also asked to put proper directive and instruction labelling on the wall in the factory for the safety of workers and visitors.\u201d Agila Godwin, a producer of industrial and domestic cleaning agents, said, \u201cThis training is actually an eye opener. We were trained in several areas: accounting, bookkeeping, marketing, packaging and safety. It was all encompassing. The benefits are such that cannot be expressed with words alone. \u201cI realise from the training that there will never be a stopping point for improvement. Someone said the only room that is always available is the room for improvement. The OSH training is one that I take so dearly to the heart. It is a known fact that even in big conglomerates, safety of workers is one thing they hardly take into serious consideration and because of this, you find a lot of occupational hazard cases. \u201cSo for my company it is a factor that must be taken seriously. Thank God for the training, I now know how to design a safe factory of international standard. I will begin to implement the things I learnt from the training immediately. And the good thing is that some of the requirements to equip a factory safety wise are actually not expensive to procure in the market; they are cost effective. So I will start taking the steps immediately, and one by one I will ensure my factory is provided with occupational safety equipment.\u201d Earlier during the launching of the Action Checklist, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, who was represented by the Ministry\u2019s Director, Occupational, Safety and Health Department, Mrs Lauretta Adogu, quoted ILO as saying that over 2.3 million women and men workers died at work from an occupational injury or disease leading to a loss of four per cent of the global GDP, every year. He went on to say that the MSMEs are vital to the economic development of a growing economy due to their dynamism, efficiency, faster decision-making processes, and tendency for innovation. The Minister added that Nigeria, one of the largest economies in Africa, has over 37 million MSMEs, which he said account for more than 84 per cent of the total jobs in the country. He also said that MSMEs contribute about 50 per cent of the nation\u2019s GDP, according to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. He said the health and economic crises created by the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown measures led to the closure of many businesses nationwide. The Minister then said that the need for healthcare and hygiene products including sanitisers, face masks and other forms of personal protective equipment had created job opportunities for many Nigerian workers. \u201cIt is generally acknowledged that a safe and healthy workplace protects workers from injury and illnesses. It also reduces economic losses associated with ill health and accidents as well as boosts productivity and employee morale at work. \u201cHence, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, through the Occupational Safety and Health Department, actively ensures the safety, health and welfare of workers. This is to protect them against hazardous working conditions through monitoring and enforcement of the basic provisions of the Factories Act CAP F1 Laws of the Federation Nigeria, 2004,\u201d he said. He added that over the last 25 years, the ILO had developed and implemented effective delivery mechanisms to improve Occupational Safety and Health and overall working conditions and productivity in MSMEs, including the informal sector. \u201cThe Ministry is not ignorant of the challenges to productivity among MSMEs in both the formal and informal economies and acknowledges the need for a better understanding of the peculiar OSH situation. This is in order to proffer practicable solutions and mechanisms for achieving safe and healthy work environments. \u201cTherefore, the Ministry, in collaboration with the ILO, is committed to empowering entrepreneurs, managers, workers and/or farmers to improve occupational safety and health working conditions. This is through a systematic identification of occupational hazards and strengthening MSMEs to manage workplace risks through best practices and acceptable risk control measures,\u201d he said. In her opening remarks, ILO Country Director to Nigeria, Ms Vanessa Phala, said that the COVlD-19 outbreak revealed a huge gap in operationalising OSH across the globe. Represented\u00a0 by Mrs Chinyere Emeka-Anuna, Ms Phala said there was pressing need to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as to support the competitiveness MSMEs According to her, Nigeria and the United Nations system devised a project aimed at strengthening the capacity of local MSMEs and manufacturers to produce high-quality PPEs and healthcare-related products. \u201cThe project, jointly implemented by ILO, the UNIDO, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and others supports the capacity of Nigerian MSMEs and manufacturers to meet both domestic and foreign demand. The component of the project has a particular focus on capacity building in the areas of OSH, business development, financial services, and decent working conditions. \u201cPromoting safety and health at work among these and other enterprises can be an important contribution in ensuring a decent and productive work environment,\u201d she said.

While MSMEs employ a large proportion of the workforce, they also tend to have higher rates of work-related accidents.\u201d The ILO boss said that through the project, the ILO had been able to support MSMEs to build and strengthen a culture of occupational safety and health. Phala said, \u201cTo further support and strengthen the MSMEs on OSH, ILO supported the Ministry to develop and validate the Action Checklist for MSMEs in Nigeria. \u201cThis serves as a tool to support MSMEs in upholding the culture of OSH in their enterprises and training manual to support trainers that will facilitate this culture. \u201cWe have also documented some OSH improvement practices which some MSMEs have carried out following the training that they received through two improvement workshops held in Lagos and Abuja.\u201d  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "business", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/osh-action-checklist-participants-say-training-eye-opening-impactful/"},

TUC further said that blaming the affected state governments for not taking preventive action to cushion the devastating effect of the flood was not going to help matters, therefore, blame games should be put aside while action to help Nigerians who are suffering should rather be in top gear. In a press statement made available to newsmen in Abuja, TUC President, Comrade\u00a0 Festus Osifo, said, \u201cThe Congress wishes to commiserate with the working people and their families over these losses caused by the floods which have swept through 33 of the 36 states of the country and have also left schools, hospitals, police stations, offices and infrastructure submerged. \u201cOver 40,000 homes have been destroyed and the nation\u2019s food security threatened. TUC insists that such a growing level of devastation ought to have elicited emergency responses in the entire country, which would have saved its citizens the pains, anguish and embarrassment they are currently subjected to. The poor, working people and their families are always vulnerable to the inactions of the government. \u201cIt is true that the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency had warned against high amounts of rainfall in September 2022 which may trigger floods in some states. It is also a fact that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) gave similar warnings, but governments at all levels did not put preventive, or at best, control measures in place but rather devoted all energies to political activities at the expense of governance.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cThe Federal Government blaming state governments for allegedly ignoring the letters of the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, informing them of the impending floods, is at this time unhelpful. \u201cWhat the country needs is a synergy by the three tiers of government to quickly come to the rescue of the displaced by immediately providing temporary shelter, warm clothing, food and medical supplies not just for the immediate, but also to combat the post-flood water borne diseases that have become inescapable. \u201cCongress appeals to corporate Nigerians to roll out flood funds of solidarity to assist the victims, while individuals can also take initiatives to come to the aid of those rendered homeless and helpless by the floods. The Federal Government should also take steps to ensure that the release of water from the Kiri, Kainji, Jebba, and Shiroro dams does not worsen the flood situation. \u201cApart from taking climate change seriously and working on meeting minimum international requirements to tackle it, the government also needs to engage our neighbours on how flooding can be controlled. For instance, the media reports that the September 13, 2022 release of excess water from Lagdo Dam in Cameroon was partly responsible for the serious level of flooding the country is experiencing.

Tagged \u20185G: The Next Wave\u2019, the Ericsson ConsumerLab report addresses the impact 5G has had on early adopter consumers since launching in various countries, as well as gauging the intention of non-5G subscribers to take up the technology \u2013 and their related expectations. The report forecasts that at least 30 per cent of smartphone users intend to take up a 5G subscription within the next few years. The mix of Ericsson tracking data covering 5G launches since 2019 and the new consumer survey, has enabled Ericsson ConsumerLab to identify six key trends impacting the next wave of 5G adoption. The report covers the behavioural changes triggered by the bundling of digital services into 5G plans by communications service providers \u2013 particularly the increased use of enhanced video and augmented reality (AR) apps. The report also addresses the speed of mainstream 5G adoption, whether consumer demands are being met and 5G-related changes in smartphone behaviour \u2013 and their impact on network traffic. More than 49,000 consumers in 37 countries were interviewed in the research \u2013 the largest global 5G-related consumer survey in the industry to date and the largest consumer survey conducted by Ericsson on any topic. The survey scope is representative of the opinions of about 1.7 billion consumers worldwide, including 430 million 5G subscribers. Mr Jasmeet Singh Sethi, Head of Ericsson ConsumerLab, said: \u201cThe scale of the research gives us an authentic insight into consumers\u2019 views and attitudes to 5G. The report shows that the next wave of potential 5G users has different expectations of the technology compared to early adopters. Overall, consumers see engaging with 5G as an essential part of their future lifestyles. \u201cIt is interesting to note that 5G is emerging as an important enabler for early adopters to embrace metaverse-related services, such as socialising, playing and buying digital items in interactive 3D virtual gaming platforms. The amount of time spent on augmented reality apps by 5G users has also doubled over the past two years, compared to 4G users.\u201d The report forecasts that 5G consumers with the experience of using extended reality (XR) functionality are likely to be the first to embrace future devices as they are more positive about the potential of mixed-reality glasses. Half of 5G users, who already use XR-related services weekly think that AR apps will move from smartphones to XR headsets within the next two years, compared to one-third of 4G consumers who hold this view. The report stated that at least 510 million consumers across 37 markets are likely to take up 5G in 2023.

The workshop was intended not only to equip the journalists with the skills required to professionally report the ICT world but to also advance cybersecurity awareness among vulnerable Nigerians. Speaking at the workshop, the Managing Director, GBB, Professor Muhammed Abubakar said, the partnership between the company and the media was a mutually beneficial one. Abubakar, represented by a Senior Manager in the company, Mr Ifedayo Balogun, said the GBB boss was happy with the depth of knowledge transfer at the workshop. \u201cThis will help the GBB push its developmental information, especially on Nigeria\u2019s digital economy drive to the public. \u201cYou have spent some days here and I\u2019m sure you already know some of the things we do and the services we provide, and I can also see a lot of knowledge sharing and transfer, the questions and the answers provided. \u201cI must say thank you very much for your attention and it is believed that this will certainly not be the end of our relationship and partnership as it is just the beginning,\u201d he said.

{"headline": "Flour Mills of Nigeria: Looking beyond  Nigerian borders", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CF-PIX-1.jpg", "author": "SULAIMON OLANREWARJU", "posted_date": "May 16, 2022", "description": "With the approval granted Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) Plc by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Nigerian Exchange Limited and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria to acquire 71.69 per cent stake in Honeywell Flour Mills (HFM) Plc and 5.06 per cent stake of the company held by First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the coast is now clear for FMN to realise its vision of becoming the leading food and agro-allied group in Africa. Over the years, though FMN has demonstrated exemplary commitment to food security in Nigeria through its investments in agriculture, livestock feed and pasta manufacturing, it has always had its eyes on the continental market with a plan to become a giant in Africa\u2019s food and agro-allied industry. This, among other factors, propelled the Honeywell Flour Mills acquisition. The acquisition has revved up its production and marketing capacity and set the stage for FMN to become a continental powerhouse. Commenting on the approval of the regulatory bodies for the acquisition, Mr Boye Olusanya, Group Managing Director, FMN said, \u201cWe are delighted that approvals have been received and we are all set to begin execution of this landmark transaction that would positively impact Nigeria\u2019s food security architecture and overall competitiveness.\u201d He added, \u201cOur combined brands and businesses will mean an expansive scale of food production for both Nigeria and Africa. Together, Flour Mills of Nigeria and Honeywell Flour Mills will be able to achieve rapid growth while maintaining high-quality products serving the evolving needs of our consumers. The acquisition will further serve as a catalyst for an even stronger stream of innovation that is focused on local content offerings, enabling our customers across the nation to seamlessly benefit from improved access to a wider product range and a robust pan-Nigerian distribution network.\u201d Mr Olusanya\u2019s submission is in tandem with experts\u2019 views on the implications of the acquisition for the FMN Group. According to industry watchers, the acquisition of HFM by FMN will result in an enlarged customer base, solid market share and better channel penetration. It will also birth a strong combination of market-leading and diverse product offerings to the Nigerian population, thus strategically positioning the company for the opportunities available in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTFA). Experts also agree that the acquisition will foster an increase in shareholder value, stronger stream of innovation focused on local content offerings, increased geographical reach even beyond the shores of Nigeria and market share with additional customers and a diverse range of complementary product offerings to cater for the growing Nigerian population. It is also believed that the acquisition will streamline supply chain and operations of both entities on the back of economies of scale, savings from improved distribution and marketing channels, technology-enabled logistics to drive down operating expenses as well as enhanced productivity and efficiencies in back offices. In the near term, the HFM acquisition will propel FMN to unprecedented revenues of over a trillion naira. But beyond the benefits to FMN, analysts are of the opinion that the acquisition would impact positively on all major stakeholders. According to them, the acquisition will create in FMN a bigger and more resilient company with capacity to create more employment opportunities as well as ensuring long-term job preservation. Customers across the nation will benefit from access to a wider product range, an even stronger stream of innovation and a robust Pan-Nigerian distribution network; accessing greater number of points of sale supported by enhanced customer focused sales teams and redistribution capabilities. In their words, \u201cThe acquisition will increase scope to deliver product innovation to meet customers\u2019 needs.\u201d Similarly, the country will benefit from the acquisition as FMN\u2019s strategic plan focused on developing the agricultural value chain and backward integration of the food industry would ultimately improve food security. But while the benefits accruable from the acquisition of a majority stake in Honeywell Flour Mills are still in the realm of projection, the company has continued with the superlative performance that has become its trademark over the years as shown in its third quarter unaudited financial report released not too long ago. In that report, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc posted a growth of 51 per cent in Q3 and 49 per cent over a period of nine months. The growth was facilitated by the Group\u2019s unwavering commitment to continuous product innovation, improved capacity utilisation, creating good consumer experience, providing strong supply chain support and effective route to market strategies. In the third quarter of the current financial year, the FMN Group recorded N302.2 billion revenue, which is 51 per cent higher than the N200.2 billion recorded in Q3 of 2021. The gross profit posted in the period under review was N25.8 billion, a 17 per cent improvement over the N22.2 billion posted in the previous year. Operating profit for the quarter was N16.4 billion, a 40 per cent rise, while profit before tax for the quarter was N9.8 billion, an improvement of five per cent over the N9.3 billion figure for Q3 2021. Profit after tax for the quarter was N6.5 billion, a 10 per cent improvement over the N5.9 billion posted in the corresponding period of 2021. Similarly, the revenue for the nine-month period stood at N825 billion, this was 49 per cent higher than the N555.3 billion recorded for the same period in 2021. Gross profit for the period leapt by 11 per cent from the N72.4 billion recorded in 2021 to N80.2 billion for the period under review. In the same vein, operating profit rose by 14 per cent from N35.5 billion in 2021 to N40.4 billion in 2022. Profit after tax also moved up from N15.9 per cent in 2021 to N17 billion in 2022, an increase of seven per cent. The Group\u2019s Food Segment had a good showing during the period under review, posting an 18 per cent overall volume growth. The growth was bolstered by accelerated focus on the small pack size segment for the noodles category in order to increase affordability. Similarly, 22 additional vans with automated performance tracking tools were deployed to deepen the redistribution infrastructure drive. The segment was also actively involved in investments in redistribution resources while working closely with the dealers \u2013 vans, rural containers and tricycles. The Sugar Segment similarly recorded 20 per cent revenue growth. Although the segment\u2019s operating performance was largely impacted by the rise in raw material cost, the strategic move by the company resulted in a positive turnaround which had already started manifesting by the end of the quarter. In the period under review, the Agro-Allied Segment recorded a volume growth of nine per cent. This is made up of 48 per cent revenue growth in the Oil & Fats value chain, 21 per cent year-on-year volume growth in the Fertilizer business and 47 per cent growth in the animal feeds value chain. The Support Segment also put up a good performance recording significant revenue and profit growth driven by increased demand in Bagco, as well as the port business which performed well with top-line growth.Over the years, the FMN Group has demonstrated its capacity to create value for its customers, its shareholders and the society at large. As it embarks on a voyage of spreading the goodness of its products beyond the borders of Nigeria into other African countries, there is no doubt that this will engender higher returns on investment, improved shareholder value as well as the transformation of the national champion into a continental colossus.

The segment also lost by 241 per cent q/q as it made N3 billion in Q4 2021 and lost N4 billion in Q4 2022. According to comments from the Group, \u201cThe segment\u2019s operating performance was largely impacted by the rise in raw material cost.\u201d The support segment made a 40 per cent profit before tax from N3 billion in 2021 to N4 billion in 2022 while it recorded a 93 per cent loss q/q having made N4 billion in Q4 2021 and made nothing in Q4 2022. By percentage contribution, the food, agro-allied, sugar and support segments contributed 50 per cent, 47 per cent, N-8 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively to the N41 billion profit before tax recorded y-o-y by the group. Commenting on the gains for the food segment, the Group said the N270 billion profit recorded in 2022 was driven largely by \u201cIncreased B2B volume contribution with most lines recording double digit growth; growth in core B2C categories: noodles and ball foods (Semo and Goldenvita); invested in product innovation (Amazing day cereal, goat meat pepper soup noodle flavour) and driving volume in economy/value pack segment; continued deepening of the B2C redistribution infrastructure drive with investments and roll out of 226 vans to enhance penetration of new/smaller SKUs and increased rural penetration through the deployment of containers, tricycles, and POS deployment.\u201d For the agro-allied segment, the Group said the implementation of a cost savings programme and installation of a seed cleaning plant to reduce frequent machine breakdown in production, gave rise to the 58 per cent revenue increase in 2022. \u201cAnimal feeds business recorded 49 per cent growth largely due to product innovation and investments in logistics infrastructure. Fertiliser business expanded with a new blending plant in Kaduna State, contributing 89 per cent and 21 per cent growth in revenue and volume, respectively,\u201d it said. The revenue and profit growth recorded in the support segment of the Group was attributed to \u201cIncreased demand for locally produced packaging material; focus on high value products; increased focus on RTM for our innovative products such as Zero Fly. \u201cABTL, the port facilities business, performed well recording double digit growth in revenue and triple digit growth in PBT. This was driven by focus on maintenance, partnerships and improved relationships with regulatory agencies. Golden transport company, the transportation logistics business also recorded 25 per cent revenue growth y-o-y, driven by increase in volume of cargo moved due to acquisition of new trucks and strategising of loading plan.\u201d With a 26 per cent increase in operating profit from N52 billion in 2021 to N66 billion in 2022 and 48 per cent increase q/q from N17 billion in Q4 2021 to N25 billion in Q4 2022, the Group suffered a 19 per cent gross loss q/q from N34 billion in Q4 2021 to N28 billion in Q4 2022 while gaining only a one per cent gross profit y-o-y from N107 billion in 2021 to N108 billion in 2022. The negative sentiment persisted in its return on equity as it lost by three per cent y-o-y from N16 billion in 2021 to N15 billion in 2022. On a q/q basis, it maintained a three per cent loss at N6 billion for Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. The Group also increased its capital source by 13 per cent from N368 billion in 2021 to N417 billion in 2022. Capital was sourced from borrowings (N159 billion from N133 billion), lease liabilities (N18 billion from N 17 billion), non-controlling interest (N9 billion from N6 billion), equity and reserves (N187 billion from N168 billion) and others (N45 billion from N44 billion).

The Group also saw a N31 billion net debt increase from N96 billion in 2021 to N127 billion in 2022. The 2022 net debt hit N100 billion since 2020 as the Group had recorded a net debt of N131 billion in 2018, N110 billion in 2019, N83 billion in 2020 and N96 billion in 2021. Further analysis showed that the 2022 net debt was made up of 72 per cent long term debt and 28 per cent short term debt. Net debt for 2021 was made up of 77 per cent long term debt and 23 per cent short term debt. In keeping with its mission to \u201cFeed the nation, everyday,\u201d FMN expanded its scope as it has concluded transaction (with a total estimated enterprise value of N80 billion and equity price per share of N4.20) for its acquisition of Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, which commenced operation under FMN from May 2022. FMN, through its affiliates acquired 71.69 per cent equity state in Honeywell as well as 5.06 per cent equity stake of FBN Holdings in Honeywell, which made it a majority stakeholder with 76.75 per cent equity stake with opertaional and managerial control. Recall that the Head of Corporate Communications, FMN, Modupe Thani, had said that the Group retained the Honeywell brand as a way of driving market competition and value for its customers. To ensure sustianability, FMN said it is committed to driving backward integration by sourcing raw materials locally, creating value through a wide range of feeds and proteins product offering, supply chain optimisation and harnessing the opportunity of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). \u201cFMN operates an efficient a supply chain system that strengthens the relationship with our suppliers and vendors and ensures continuous improvements and increase quality of control. To achieve this, we have adopted innovative supply chain planning and methods for different aspects of our supply chain activities. \u201cFMN has implemented its Backward Integration Program (BIP)\u00a0 and is committed to promoting research and innovation on local content raw materials with the focus of creating a range of local content driven products and reducing dependence on imported raw materials,\u201d it said. Consistent with its unique product offering style, the Group said it established an Innovation Centre which comprises of innovative staff office, boardroom, analytical laboratory, pilot plant, sensory lab and kitchen to drive process and product innovation while ensuring consumer satisfaction. With presence in rural and semi-rural parts of 11 states of Nigeria, FMN keeps living upto its good corporate citizenship by investing in key sectors of its communities like education, health and infrastructure. In his comments on the result, the Group Managing Director, FMN, Omoboyede Olusanya, said the achievements were attributable to the Group\u2019s innovation across its products while priotising backward integration by locally sourcing its raw materials. \u201cWe remain committed to implementing our long-term plan with further investments in local content via product innovation across our five major value chains. Our substantial underlying earnings demonstrate our commitment to achieving sustainability as we drive to achieve food security in the country, given the challenging operating environment over the years. \u201cWith the acquisition of Honeywell Flour Mills Plc. (HFMF) and the attendant differentiated offers, our portfolio continues to evolve, strategically positioning the Group for opportunities from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). \u201cWith the appointment of our third female board member and the promotion of gender diversity throughout our business segments, our sustainability agenda made more strides in line with our long-standing commitment to women\u2019s empowerment. In addition, we developed a local content, food security, and nutrition board committee to improve the well-being of our consumers, assist in regenerating and strengthening the farming communities in our supply chains, and promote local economic development. \u201cIn line with our strategy, we will continue to increase operational efficiency with accelerated plans for cost optimisations across the Group.

Among the pressing issues ASUP condemned are, \u201cThe lack of transparency, as well as stakeholders exclusion in the processes leading to the release and allocation of the approved N15 billion revitalisation fund for public polytechnics in the country; the conclusion of the ASUP/FGN re-negotiation of the 2010 agreement; revision and release of an acceptable scheme of service for polytechnics; withdrawal of the contradictory template for the appointment of principal officers and the need to replace same, as observed by the union; appointment of a substantive Rector for Federal Polytechnic Offa, Kwara State.\u201d Rising from its 104th National Executive Meeting held in Abuja, ASUP, in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by its Publicity Secretary, Abdullahi Yalwa, also harped on the issue of poor funding of Nigerian polytechnics and it ripple effects to both the operation of the institutions, the student and quality of the products of tertiary education. The communiqu\u00e9 read, \u201cNEC decried the sustained poor funding of member institutions which has derailed the actualisation of the mandates of these institutions. NEC decried the inadequacies in the operation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), introduced by the Federal Government and some state governments, as such has been shown to be opaque and a poor fit for tertiary institutions. \u201cNEC equally condemned the poor funding profiles of several state-owned institutions in the country. NEC noted that the poor funding outlook of these institutions has denied the institutions access to enough funds for the purposes of accreditation and re-accreditation of programmes, infrastructural development, mounting of new courses, sourcing and engagement of competent personnel, and the day -o-day running of the institutions. \u201cNEC frowned at the wastages of scarce resources by the government and the tacit endorsement of impunity in the sector as evidenced by the non-implementation of the reports of the visitation panels set up for federal polytechnics in 2012; and the non release of the white paper for 2021 visitation. \u201cNEC noted with discomfort the harassment of its members at the Federal Polytechnic Ado-Ekiti by the EFCC Zonal office in Ilorin under the guise of investigating allegations of fraud in the institution.   While recognising the statutory duties of the anti graft agency, we are convinced that such duties should be discharged in accordance with the rule of law without undermining the dignity and self worth of our members, and indeed other citizens. \u201cNEC observed with dismay, the current suspension of the activities of the Governing Council of Federal Polytechnic, Oko by the Federal Ministry of Education. The union notes that such is in dissonance with the provisions of the Federal Polytechnic\u2019s Act and as such has created an avoidable vacuum in the governance of the institution. This is currently having adverse consequences on staff welfare issues and general wellbeing of the institution. \u201cThe union also condemned the non representation of the union\u2019s members at Federal Colleges of Agriculture in the process of amending the scheme and condition of service of the institutions by Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria (ARCN).\u201d On the poor handling of trade disputes in the education sector by the government, ASUP said, \u201cNEC noted with great disappointment the persistent failure of FGN to honour resolutions and agreements signed with unions in the tertiary education sector which has resulted in frequent declarations of industrial actions in the sector. \u201cNEC noted that despite the patriotic leanings of the unions, the government has been compounding the conflicts by their actions and inactions. NEC made copious reference to the tardy handling of the industrial crises in the university system by the government where the situation has degenerated to the deployment of starvation, judicial intimidation and shameless plots of balkanisation of unions, as instruments of conflict resolution particularly in its dealings with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). \u201cNigerians should rally round the staff unions in the tertiary sector and ensure that citizens are not blocked from having access to quality education at the tertiary level. Nigerians should deploy every lawful instrument to resist any attempt by the government to make public tertiary institutions inaccessible to the masses. \u201cFederal Ministry of Labour to desist from the plot to balkanise ASUU and ensure that the registration and recognition of any new union in the university system in particular and the tertiary education landscape in general is in sync with the law. \u201cThe government to release salaries owed to members of ASUU, SSANU, NAAT, and NASU in the Nigerian university system to facilitate restoration of sustainable industrial harmony; and to deploy the globally accepted instrument of collective bargaining in resolving trade disputes in the sector. \u201cASUP therefore stands in unfettered solidarity with ASUU in its current engagement with the government.\u201d  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "business", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/asup-decried-fgs-snail-speed-approach-to-pressing-issues-in-polytechnics-declares-support-for-asuu/"},

The business has built a stellar reputation in just one year for providing Nigerians with a huge selection of travel products online. Since its launch in 2021, tech travel agency, TravelTank has been on a mission to make travel planning and bookings quick, fun and affordable using technology. Founded on September 16th 2021, the company is contributing to the tourist environment by making travel opportunities accessible to everyone. In a bid to further establish its stake and contributions to the Nigerian travel ecosystem, the company celebrated its 1st Anniversary by organizing a Webinar series on Friday, September 16th 2022 titled, TravelTank @1: Revitalizing the post-covid online travel experience. Mr Charles C. Chukwujekwe, the CEO of Travel Quest Limited, Ms. Annabel Bonney, Founder of Travevo travel & migration and Travevo properties, Oluwabunmi Abe The founder of EasyTravelsConnect, Tochi Margaret Umezinwa is the Director of Fly up Travel and Tours Limited and Henry Tugbiyele Founder and CEO of Expatico and Yemi Smith, CEO of TravelTank were on the Webinar panel to drive conversations around stimulating post-covid travel solutions in Nigeria and across the globe. While speaking on resolving past challenges in the tourist industry, Founder and CEO of Expatico, Henry Tugbiyele stated, \u201cone thing we cannot take away is that humans need to travel. There must be movement. Before the pandemic local tourism was not in the spotlight and during the pandemic that part of tourism suffered\u201d. According to Tugbiyele, the travel industry has to refocus on home first, in his words, \u201cThere must be provision to get people to appreciate Nigeria as a destination\u201d. Charles Chukwujekwe buttressed the point stating, \u201cwe cannot make local tourism happen without the serious input of the government. Covid-19 exposed us to a lot of uncertainties and if we focus our attention on local tourism, we would reduce the FX problem we are struggling with today\u201d. Mr Smith, CEO, TravelTank contributed thus, \u201cPartnership is definitely key. We need to develop strong partnerships amongst ourselves. Yes, we need the government\u2019s help, but at the same, we travel agents need to look inwards and develop partnerships with each other to allow inbound tourism to scale and flourish. A lot of us are distanced and in different regions, so it will take value-laced collaboration to make local tourism truly flourish in the country\u201d. Within its first year, TravelTank\u2019s business growth has extended exponentially. From 5 travel sharks to over 20 hungry travel sharks. From less than 7 flight bookings in September 2021 to well over 10,000 bookings to date as well as an increase in its affiliate membership base from 20 to over 278 to date. \u201cIt has been an incredible run, and we are thrilled that our customers value our online offerings,\u201d said Mr Smith. \u201cOur company views the occasion of our one-year anniversary as an opportunity to reflect on the lessons we have learnt as a whole and to reaffirm our vision for the online travel industry for the coming year and beyond,\u201d he said. Branching out, from independent flight booking services at the beginning of 2022, to providing other travel supplementary services to its ever-growing clientele, TravelTank now connects its affiliate members to other value-added travel services thus empowering more and more small business units within the travel industry. \u201cThroughout Nigeria, we have partnered with some wonderful travel agents. While it has been challenging at times with an uncertain economy, especially due to the pandemic, our focus has always been to provide our affiliates access to a wide range of travel products online with impressive rates,\u201d TravelTank\u2019s Affiliate Manager said. As indicative of TravelTank\u2019s anniversary theme, \u201cSailing the Horizons\u201d, The online travel agency envisions a world in which travel consumers can quickly research, plan, and book their travel using the power of technological innovation while saving time and money.

Every 5 in 7 people suffer from malaria per week. Malaria, known to be one of the world\u2019s top deadliest diseases, is a major threat to economic development and public health in any country. Several methodologies for eradicating malaria in Nigeria have been initiated by different organizations, foundations, and non-profit organizations. Although the fight against malaria is an unending one, Nigeria\u2019s resilience in fighting against malaria is one for the books. Nigerians have used several insecticides such as creams, paper, coils, and sprays. It is no surprise that the Nigerian market is reacting positively to the emergence of electric insecticides. With the constant struggles we face in Nigeria against malaria, an innovation such as this is important in tackling malaria. Electric Liquid insecticides or vaporizers, work automatically. Once a power source is available, the plugged-in device immediately starts to diffuse the liquid throughout the room. The liquid is composed of substances that are harmful to mosquitoes but still allow people to stay safely in the room; meaning that it is safe when inhaled by humans yet effective at curbing mosquitoes. These electric insecticides work best indoors than outdoors. A notable brand making waves in the market is Godrej Nigeria- the makers of Goodknight. The innovators of the spray inside, stay inside insecticides have yet again created a wholesome technology used in the fight against malaria. Their latest innovation is the Goodknight Power Activ+. The Power Activ + liquid contains 50% more Activ Molecules which makes it 50% more powerful. It comes with a superior heating system that ensures low electricity consumption yet with a consistent release of the Power Activ+. This electric insecticide is safe for the whole family including children. It also comes with dual mode technology; 50% more powerful on Normal mode and even more powerful on Activ mode.

Since time is equivalent to money in today\u2019s society, it is impossible for anybody to afford to spend their time. An inverter battery is essential for use in areas that are prone to experiencing frequent power outages. Batteries used in inverters are designed to maintain their ability to provide a low level of current for a significant portion of their lifespan. Batteries that are used in inverters do not get depleted for a much longer amount of time. In this article, we will discuss how to acquire inverter batteries as well as the questions that are asked the most often by customers. Before purchasing a battery, one of the most apparent inquiries customers have is regarding its backup time. What is the battery\u2019s reserve capacity? A client may choose a 4-hour backup period if he or she dwells in a city where electricity is anticipated to be restored more quickly. A client may choose a 24-hour backup period if he resides in a small town or hamlet where grid power restoration may take longer. Depending on his needs and location, he may decide on battery backup time and then make a decision. What battery technology is easily accessible on the market? Normal batteries are the most popular kind of battery available on the market. They are created locally and are unbranded. Typically, they are flat batteries.

{"headline": "Virtual Media Africa will transform Nigeria\u2019s entertainment industry \u2014App developer", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daniel-2.jpg", "author": "SULAIMON OLANREWAJU", "posted_date": "Sep 12, 2022", "description": " I believe that ideas come to individuals not for the fun of it but to make changes about the problems that not only affect your close society but often times, the world. Over the years I have worked on different projects majorly aimed at making societal improvements and my truest motivation has been the same from Day 1. How do I make Nigeria better? How do I contribute and be part of the rebuilding process in an era of data and technology? I think in all the darkest times where I spent myself in solitude meditating on the right ways to make this product great and this is true because every building process has its dark moments where you are alone and you question everything constructively to make sure you have no stones left unturned. When I searched myself at those times as to why and what really motivated me to develop this app, My only answer is that- to make this country better, to create an income stream for entertainers in an era where quality education has become a luxury, people with talent can get paid in their own virtual online offices showing everything that is great about them.  Virtual Media Africa addresses a lot of problems, we are just barely surviving from Covid-19 era where entertainers could not earn income from mass gathering events due to social distancing measures and restrictions. It is becoming more obvious that the world is changing and the meta verse has become an alternate space where the world can still go on while the problems in our physical society is being addressed and solved. We cannot have the incomes of Nigerian entertainers paused, if such a thing happens again and we cannot even wait for it to happen again, instead we can start to introduce a solution that they can be familiarised with. This solution which we call VMA is an app that lets musicians, comedians and all entertainers stream their paid content virtually and even with the option of virtual reality headsets, they can host concerts where people around the world can attend from the comfort of their living rooms. The VMA app gives entertainers the ability to have and own their online offices and get paid for their content from around the world. It limits the costs of travelling, event centre bookings, crowd management planning to prevent crisis and all the necessary steps involved in holding a proper event or festival. These entertainers and event planners can host their events in the meta verse, from the comfort of their living rooms, eradicating a lot of costs, expanding their fan base across the world and most importantly earn money through the aid of our imbedded paid plug-ins on the app.  To facilitate ease of deployment, A smart phone is literally all you need to download the App as a content creator and be able to stream your content on our network and for a viewer, a smart phone is needed to watch the content or a virtual reality headset to have the full immersion experience. It is really exciting and more exciting that we could have an easy payment arrangement with Flutterwave to aid the income payments to entertainers. Generally, I think idea duplication is a common phenomenon in the innovative business world but what really could set you apart is your vision. People can only imitate you to a certain level and not all the way if they do not understand your final destination, purpose or aims. What we are set to launch is a piece of a huge ice cake idea that we had to break down to the barest minimum just to introduce the world to our dream. The rest of the whole journey is huge and the versions we would release over the years is something that keeps me not bothered about being imitated, just because I know where we are headed. We believe that in our mission, we aren\u2019t just empowering all entertainers but all youths with dreams and once the possibility to earn is established, we have an increased population with purchasing power and that generally\u00a0 improves the\u00a0 overall economy in all manners of things. Alternatively, a functioning company that we strive to be is also liable to taxes to the Nigerian government where applicable.  Over the years, from 2017 when I launched the Noxiae hotel reviews in Nigeria which till date visits Nigerian hotels and apartments, rates them and recommends them to incoming tourists. It operates and functions greatly on its website platform solely. Then in 2021, I launched the Noxiaevr, which we had been experimenting on since 2020 because of Covid-19. I was thinking well if people cannot travel to Nigeria at the moment, how can we create an alternate feel and experience for them that looks like they are currently here?\u00a0 While I was working on Noxiae virtual reality, I understood that not only did this problem affect tourism and hospitality but also entertainment in general. The world is changing and the quest for more knowledge sent me for my Masters in International Tourism, Hospitality and Events Management in England. I could grasp the changes in modern tourism measures due to the Covid-19 crises and have an in-depth analysis into creating an app for virtual events and how to manage it.\u00a0 I would say the knowledge, experience, growth and studies I have made over the years, properly prepared me for the creation and Launch of VMA in 2022.  Generally, I can hypothetically see the future of software applications in virtual and augmented reality spaces. I think this is where the shift is going to. We live in an era where companies aim to reduce labour costs through the introductions of machines and artificial intelligence devices. In the meta-verse, people can actually go through trainings without actually being there, people can visit places around the world without actually getting on a plane and this comfort will create more demands. These demands will affect the creations of the next generation mobile apps which will be created to solve problems as usual.  Sincerely, I think reliable and affordable internet is a problem in Nigeria and should be something that should be priority in the government yearly budgets at this stage. Its alarming that they do not even consider it even with kids left at home uneducated due to the strike actions, a lot of education and skills can be added to their lives just with accessible and reliable internet. Primarily for everyone into ICT in Nigeria, no great dream can be easily achieved with the high prices of internet bundles in terms of costs. I am aware some progress has been made over the years but a lot more can still be done. The government really needs to address the foundations of our tech sector which is the accessibility to internet and the affordability of it.

You can decide to assess your energy usage by using tailored reporting and secure a business energy contract that is suitable for the purchasing strategy of your business. Fortunately, can help you accomplish all these. With their wealth of experience and knowledge, they can manage your energy portfolio, especially when your resources are stretched. Remember that energy brokers can do various things for your business. This article discusses the role of a business energy broker in the energy purchasing process. A business energy broker can help you to find competitive energy deals and set up new business energy contracts with energy suppliers. This decreases the amount of time you need to do administration tasks when you are searching for business energy deals. Thanks to the good relationships business energy brokers have with energy providers, energy brokers utilize their energy market buying power to negotiate with energy suppliers, getting business energy deals that energy consumers may not have managed to get by themselves. In return, a business energy broker usually may agree to a small commission with the energy consumers that can be added to the energy price, or it can be a monthly fixed fee. Remember that there is a lot more to utilizing a business energy broker than simply handling your energy billing. Larger businesses that consider energy as a strategic function can use an energy broker to get advice on various aspects of negotiation, procurement, energy planning, and many more. When operating a business, it can sometimes be hard to have enough resources that you can use in your daily operations. And, business energy is an area that needs in-depth knowledge of the market, different contract terms, , and many more, so it can be tough to find the time for this niche. This is where a business energy broker can be useful. Besides managing your business energy, they often work together with energy suppliers and use their knowledge and expertise to offer you a wide range of benefits. One of the challenges that most business owners face is the increasing costs of business energy. For many businesses, the major reason for switching business energy contracts or business energy suppliers is to save money. A business energy broker can monitor the energy market and utilize resources at their disposal to give you energy options that meet the budget of your business. When you have other things to handle for your business, it can be hard to find enough time to research business energy suppliers, compare energy quotes, and negotiate energy prices. Also, it\u2019s crucial to track the volatile energy market and understand energy market trends, but many business owners don\u2019t have the expertise or time to do it effectively. This is the reason why you need to work with a business energy broker so that they can deal with the hard work. This gives you a lot of free time to operate your business with a better focus. The energy industry uses a lot of technical jargon that can be confusing to most business owners. A business energy broker has expert knowledge and can answer any questions or concerns you may have. Even better, they can give you clear explanations so that you can understand everything before signing a business energy contract. You just need to give your business energy broker a Letter of Authority to allow them to act for you and discuss any issues you may have with your energy supplier The best business energy brokers are those that try to create a good working relationship with you during your time together. You can find some reputable business energy companies that can assign you a relationship manager who provides consistent service, is the first point of contact, and makes sure that you receive your business energy bills quickly. They can do all these while handling any queries with energy suppliers to make sure that there is a timely resolution. You should note that the services business energy brokers offer usually vary, but there are some common services. With a business energy broker, you can have quick access to energy quotes from different gas and electricity suppliers, and you don\u2019t need to contact them yourself. A good business broker can also compile these energy quotes in the right format to make it easier for you to compare them. An energy broker can also provide bill validation. This can save you administrative time while giving you peace of mind knowing that you are only paying for the energy that your business uses. You can find some energy brokers that have online portals that allow energy consumers to check their energy consumption, so they can correctly budget and understand their energy usage patterns. A business energy broker can also handle the switching of energy suppliers on your behalf. This means they can handle all communications between the new energy supplier and your current energy supplier. Aside from these, a business energy broker can always work in your best interest and can send you notifications to let you know that your business energy contract is about to come to an end. This is a good service because you can avoid getting more expensive out-of-contract energy rates. When your business energy contract nears expiration, your business energy broker can offer you a list of potential business energy contracts for you to consider. In conclusion, it can be hard to choose the best business energy deal from various energy suppliers. With several daily energy rates and different energy tariffs, you need to understand a variety of business energy contracts available on the market. The good thing is that a business energy broker can work with you so that you may understand your business energy consumption patterns and the type of business energy contract that matches your business model.

{"headline": "Financial intelligence, mastery, make better individuals \u2014Alade-Mustapha", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Temi-Alade-Mustapha-Executive-Director-TAM-Money-Mastery-Academy.jpg", "author": "NCHETACHI CHUKWUAJAH", "posted_date": "Oct 3, 2022", "description": " I believe that whatever happens to us in life is a message for others to learn from. I have had some challenges in my finances and I was able to overcome them. The lessons I learnt from that incident helped me to create a framework for managing my finances and I also made up my mind to help other people do the same. Being a banker for over 15 years, I have seen a lot of financial errors people make. Keeping them to myself would have meant being selfish. So, I wrote my first book, Money Maths, in 2019 and I began to train individuals to manage their finances. One of the burdens in my heart has been how to effectively bring about community transformation in a sustainable way. Over the years, I have done all types of training in different areas in a bid to help people bring sustainable change to their lives, family and society. Despite all my efforts, the results were not encouraging and that caused me to begin to look for real answers. I discovered that without financial education and wealth creation, it is almost impossible to bring any lasting change in society. I am passionate about sharing the principles of money and wealth creation as a means of eradicating systemic poverty and bringing cultural transformation. The framework I used was what was later developed into the curriculum for TAM Money Mastery Academy. This Academy was set up for three reasons: to raise awareness about the need for everyone to become financially responsible and intelligent; to help founders of startups and emerging leaders access world class and highly subsidised financial mastery training; and to build a network of leaders who are financially successful and are working together to provide strategic platforms and support to those within their communities through sustainable initiatives, programmes and projects. The eight weeks intensive training exposes students to money making, money management, money multiplication and money sustainability mastery. If they successfully complete the course, they will become trained money mastery and personal financial management professionals. Our simplified and practical-based programmes help people to make, manage, multiply and sustain their money in order to build enduring wealth. Looking at the impact the graduates of TAM Money Mastery Academy are bringing to their communities, I feel strongly that I have found the true solution to bring about lasting impact.  We believe that no matter who you are, where you are from or what you do you need to be financially intelligent. Financial intelligence makes responsible individuals. So our plan is to ensure that everyone from anywhere around the world can access it and that is why we have the online as well as physical version of the academy which is on our online platform and can be accessed from anywhere around the world.  For me, it has been an exciting journey seeing people move from being clueless to mastery of money in a few weeks. It means that whatever one sets one\u2019s mind to achieve, one can actually achieve it, especially with the help of a coach or a mentor the journey will be short. That is what our goal is at TAM Money Mastery Academy \u2013 to help ordinary people become masters of their finances.  Those who are coming to the academy should expect to learn how to make, manage, multiply and sustain their money and become trained money mastery and personal financial management professionals. The training comes with practicals, project execution, certificate at completion, physical and combined graduation ceremony. The course modules include money making mindset, emotional intelligence, selling codes, accounting essentials, and others. We will be taking them through a practical financial management journey. This model has proven to be effective. The Academy accords students the opportunity for self discovery; intrapersonal motivation, that is, getting inspired and challenged from within; and of course, getting the very best out of oneself. Students are encouraged to get through the classes by their own sustained hard work while developing the much needed courage to face the challenges of learning. They are also encouraged to develop certain qualities of character and mind to whatever feat they set their minds on. These qualities include empathy, rigour, the capacity to think independently, to listen politely, and, when necessary, to disagree without being disagreeable.\u00a0 Equipped with these qualities, students are fully empowered to seek out new opportunities with confidence knowing that they can contribute, that they are ready, and that they can overcome challenges and unexpected setbacks. Registration for the next cohort which starts in October has begun and will last till October 12 while classes will start on October 15.  The category of people who can join the Academy include career and business professionals, entrepreneurs and any serious minded individual who wants to master how to manage his or her money sustainably. People who work 9 to 5 jobs and need other streams of income in addition to their paid employment are also encouraged to join the Academy.  The future of banking in Nigeria will continue to be shaped by innovation and technological disruptions. The journey from the analog to industrial age and now information age, specifically the\u00a0 use of the internet, has unlocked unprecedented disruption of banking business. There are lots of ways entrepreneurs can get funding in Nigeria. Governments, individuals and organisations are actively working on this. Entrepreneurs need to position themselves and their businesses to be able to get the right funding for their type of business.

{"headline": "Cause and effect in leadership", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/L9.jpg", "author": "Sulaimon Olanrewaju", "posted_date": "Oct 17, 2022", "description": "Cause and effect is the principle that rules the world. Nothing happens for nothing; everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens without a cause; every manifestation is a response to something else. Rains don\u2019t just fall; rainfall is the effect of water evaporation from the earth surface. Earthquakes don\u2019t just occur; they are caused by the cracking of rocks underground along a fault line. Lightning doesn\u2019t happen by happenstance; it is precipitated by the collision of two electrically-charged clouds. Men don\u2019t just succeed, neither do they just fail; success or failure is an effect of certain causes. Organizations don\u2019t just thrive or crumble. Every effect is a product of a cause and every cause is a precursor of an effect.  Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of people; those who take charge of the cause and those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 Those who take charge of the cause precipitate actions; they do not wait to be acted upon. Those who take charge of the cause determine the course. They understand that the best way to get a good effect is to be in charge of the cause. They know that it is only those who control the cause that can determine the effect. Therefore, they take their destiny in their hands; they do not allow themselves to become willing victims of situations and circumstances. By being proactive, they protect themselves from harmful effects. These are history makers, men and women who shape and change the world. Those who do not take charge of the cause do not initiate actions on a regular basis. Their attitude is \u2018let it happen on its own\u2019 so they allow life to happen to them and often put themselves at the receiving end of others\u2019 actions. They are victims of circumstances, thrown hither and thither by the twists and turns of life. Those who do not control the cause are always at the mercy of the effect, they are those who find themselves on the wrong side of history. Taking charge of the cause or failing to do so is a cause with a definite effect. However, those who dodge the heat of pro-activity have to face the burns of reactivity.  As it is with men, so it is with organizations and nations. Some organizations determine the effect by putting themselves in control of the cause. Rather than do catch up, they chart new paths. They do not leave their fate in the hands of circumstances; they stay in the present, travel to the future and create the kind of future that suits them. They control the cause and are able to determine the effect. These are organisations that stand tall at all times irrespective of the vicissitudes of life. Organisations that leave the levers of the cause to others and do catch up are those that are swept away during trying times.  Immunization is the system of stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent. When a person is exposed to an immunogen in a controlled way, the body learns to protect itself and develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of immunological memory. So, by injecting a small amount of a virus into the body the body develops the immunity to ward off more disastrous attacks of the virus. Immunization is taking charge of the cause so as to control the effect. The exposure to a small quantity of the virus fortifies the body against major attacks. Rather than wait for the infection and its debilitating effects, immunization gives the potential victim the power to control what the effects would be. By controlling the cause, the potential victim determines the effect of the virus and is not at its mercy.  Great leaders take charge of the cause to determine the effect they want. They do not take chances because they bear in mind Murphy\u2019s Law which states that whatever can go wrong will go wrong. They know that taking right actions prevent wrong results. So, they take charge by taking right steps that will guarantee right results. Here are some of the ways leaders take charge of the cause to determine the effect.  When leaders communicate regularly and effectively with their followers, they are able to rally them round the vision of the organization. Great leaders do not just communicate to inform; they communicate to transform. By sharing on a regular basis the vision, value and aspiration of the organization with the workforce, the people become focused because they know what is important to the organization and that is what they devote the totality of their attention to. When people are focused, synergy is unleashed. When synergy is unleashed, the seemingly difficult things become a walkover while the impossible come within the realm of possibility.  Environment plays a critical role in the productivity level of everyone. While a conducive environment stimulates creativity and enhances productivity, a stifling environment kills ingenuity and enervates the people. Creating an atmosphere that encourages people to air their views without any fear of reprimand will produce a workforce that is willing to work its heart out. Creating an environment where people are at liberty to make mistakes in the course of their duty will result in a workforce that is not afraid of trying new things. It is often in the process of trying new things without the nudging fear of the consequences of failure that great products are discovered.  No one can function beyond his knowledge level. People do what they know. Therefore, to do more, they have to know more. Organizations that want to optimize the capacity of their workforce have to boost the competence of the workforce by exposing the workers to training and capacity development programmes because people can only do new things when they know new things. To go beyond its current level of innovation, an organization must allow its people to learn new things.  Toyota Motor Corporation popularised this phrase which is about good products being the effect of good thinking. Good thinking precedes good products; good thinking begets good products. Everyone thinks. The thinking faculty is part of what makes anyone human. Every human being has the capacity to think deeply but not everyone activates this capacity. It is only those who go into deep thinking that come up with great outcomes. Great things are not found on the surface. Silver, gold and diamond are not found on the surface of the earth; they are situated deep down the belly of the earth. If these stones are located on the face of the earth like the common stones, they would not be referred to as precious. So, getting products that would wow the world would require uncommon thinking. Those who do common things get common results. But doing uncommon thing is preceded by uncommon thinking. Those who do uncommon thinking give the world uncommon products. Leaders should not put any lid on the thinking of their followers. Great products of the future are buried in the minds of the people, only profound thinking can unearth them. So, leaders should precipitate good thinking to come up with good products.  Leaders determine what happens in their organizations. What leaders permit stays, what they reject dies. So, leaders determine the culture and the temperature of their organizations. An organization\u2019s culture is what it is known for. As noted by Aristotle, we are what we do repeatedly. Therefore, the culture of an organization is its consistent, observable patterns of doing things. Organizational culture encompasses values and behaviours which make an organization unique. But right values don\u2019t grow on their own, neither do right behaviours become the norm naturally; their seeds are sowed, cultivated and nurtured by the leaders. Emergence of the right culture in a system is the consequence of having a firm leadership. The natural tendency of man is to take advantage of every situation. It is having a firm leadership in place that curtails every propensity to abuse the system. When clearly stated rules of engagement are dispassionately enforced, a great organizational culture is birthed.  Leaders who are worried about the mistrust of their followers need to take another look at their openness. The expectations of many followers are not unreasonable. Even when things are not going as well as expected, they are willing to stick out their necks for their leaders if the leaders have demonstrated integrity and openness. So, when leaders walk their talk and conduct their affairs in a manner that leaves no questions about their intentions, they earn the trust of others.  When leaders sow the seed of compassion they reap the harvest of commitment. What leadership demands from the followers most of the time is total commitment. But commitment does not happen in a vacuum. When leaders demonstrate interest in the affairs of their subordinates beyond the call of duty, what they earn in return is the total commitment of such subordinates. Law of reciprocity says that everyone who has been well treated has a proclivity to want to return the gesture. This is more so if the gesture is from those in high offices. So, having a committed workforce is a response to the compassion of the leadership.  Nothing strengthens a system like fairness and nothing destroys an organization like injustice. One manifestation of injustice is a wonky reward system; a situation in which some get what they don\u2019t deserve while others do not get what they deserve. Not only does such system kill motivation, it also promotes wrong values. But when the workers have no doubt that their efforts to improve the lot of the organization would not go unrewarded, they will strive harder for the organization to get better. Even those who are not pulling their weight enough will be motivated to work harder to increase their contributions. This would produce a system in which there is healthy competition. However, when the reward system does not follow any known pattern but is subject to the whims and caprices of those in leadership, unhealthy rivalry will be the result.  In the final analysis, leadership is the cause; every other thing is an effect. This is because it is the call of leaders to determine the end from the beginning.

{"headline": "Beliefs that transform leaders", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1bnm.jpg", "author": "Sulaimon Olanrewaju", "posted_date": "Oct 10, 2022", "description": "BELIEFS are powerful; they shape perspective and define behaviours. Beliefs either enhance or vitiate life. What we believe either strengthens our resolve or weakens it. Beliefs determine actions and inactions. The fundamental difference between the successful and those who are not is in their belief systems. Hence, the appropriateness of Henry Ford\u2019s assertion that whether you think you can or you think you can\u2019t you are right.  For over 4,000 years, it was believed that no human being could complete the one-mile race under four minutes. Many people had taken tiger milk and other performance-enhancing drinks and food but the harder they tried, the more they failed. But Roger Bannister, then an Oxford University medical student, who missed a medal at the 1952 Olympics in the 1500 meters race, made up his mind to be the first human being to complete the race under four minutes. He set to work and achieved the feat on May 6, 1954, finishing the race in three minutes and 59.4 seconds. Bannister\u2019s achievement changed many people\u2019s belief about the race to the extent that in less than two months after the feat, two other people were able to complete the race in less than four minutes. Since then, thousands of athletes have been able to complete the race even faster than Bannister did. This was something nearly everyone had believed was impossible for thousands of years. So, beliefs determine performance. It is as a result of this that great leaders have a set of beliefs that spurs them to success.  Successful people take charge of their lives; they don\u2019t leave their affairs to chances. Their dictum is not what is going to be is going to be; it is if it will be it is up to me. They know that nothing turns up until someone turns it up. They know that for their situation to change, they have to change. They do not put themselves at anyone\u2019s mercy, they create the kind of life they want for themselves. They do not cede the right to anyone to determine how their lives will turn out, they take charge. They do not allow anyone to spoil their mood, they take control of their mood. They do not allow any circumstance to hold them down; they take charge and become masters over situations and circumstances. They know that they are primarily responsible for what happens to them, so they take full responsibility for what they permit in their lives. Many people are held down because they go about looking for who to blame for what is happening in their lives. For as long as they travel that route, they are unable to take the required steps that will steer them away from that course so they go deeper and further into the mess. That is how problems compound and become intractable. But successful people do not allow that to happen to them. They take charge of their lives and steer the wheel of their lives in the direction they want. A young man went to an elderly man who had a reputation for great wisdom with the sole aim of denting his claim to wisdom. The young man was holding a bird in his hands. When he got to him, he asked the old man to say whether the bird in his hand was dead or alive. The old man knew that if he said the bird was alive, he would kill it and if he said it was dead, he would free it. So, he told the young man, \u201cIt is in your hands. Whether the bird will live or die is in your hands.\u201d Successful people know that their destiny is in their hands, so they take charge of it.  Successful people never believe that anything is impossible. Their firm belief is that there is always a way out of any labyrinth, and it is their responsibility to find it out. So, in time of serious challenges, they do not allow themselves to be overwhelmed. Those who get stuck in problems are those who are so intimidated by the difficulty that their thinking faculty becomes paralysed. Having fed their brains with so much lies about the situation, the brain, rather than work to proffer a solution, shuts down and returns a message of impossibility. So, they stay in the rut. Leaders who believe that there is always a way out of a problem are driven by the belief that they are greater than the challenge they face. So, they keep working on the situation, trying to get a solution until they find the way out. The truth about challenges is that they are structured to test our resolve. Anyone who has a weak resolve will capitulate to challenges but those with strong resolve are able to stand their ground until the solution is found.  An excuse is an explanation for failing to effect a change or missing a target. It is a justification for why something is the way it is, and not the way it should be. More often than not, it involves putting the blame for not doing the expected on somebody else or an extraneous factor. An excuse is an alibi for shirking responsibility; it is a vehicle for unloading on another person\u2019s doorstep what should have been on one\u2019s shoulders. It is the chosen haven for those who have forsaken their paradise. Hence, those who make excuses hardly ever make anything else. Successful people do not pick up an excuse even if they find one on the floor. They don\u2019t use the poor state of the economy as an excuse for not getting their desired result; they succeed in spite of the poor economy. Successful people do not use the hostile environment as an excuse for non-performance; they strive to achieve their aim in spite of the environment. They do this because they know that while it is convenient to give excuses for not achieving set target, nobody can rise above the excuses they permit.  Toyin Subair\u2019s indigenous pay television company, HItv, stormed the nation with a big bang when it was launched. It appeared poised to give Multichoice\u2019s DStv a good fight. It actually almost edged the South African competitor out of the market, especially after getting the licence to broadcast the English Premier League (EPL) matches. But the company ran into a hitch after a while because of the difficulty it had with raising fund from banks to pay for the renewal of the EPL licence. The licence to broadcast EPL matches was eventually given to DStv, its competitor. With the loss of the licence, HItv went down. Subair\u2019s excuse? The company had racked up debts and there were infightings among the shareholders. As a result of that, a promising company was allowed to go under. But when DStv lost the EPL licence to HItv a few years earlier, rather than allow the company to die, what the management did was to introduce indigenous films and programmes to woo its Nigerian audience. That gave rise to Nollywood movies being broadcast for 24 hours daily on a DStv channel. But that one channel has now grown to almost 10 channels. Multichoice did not allow its failure to get the EPL licence to destroy its operation. Unlike the HItv leadership, the management did not rely on excuses to wreck the organization.  While successful people see failure as a bend on the road and are motivated to follow the bend in the pursuit of their dream, unsuccessful ones see failure as the end of the road and give up. Successful people never give up on their dreams. If they don\u2019t get what they want the first time, they keep trying until they achieve their hearts\u2019 desire. If that aspect of their lives seems like a closed road, they go somewhere else. They never stop until they achieve their aim.  Al Gore had his eyes on the United States of America\u2019s presidency and for 24 years he made steady progress towards the realization of that goal. He was a congressman representing Tennessee for eight years; he was later elected a senator representing Tennessee for eight years between 1985 and 1993 and served as President Bill Clinton\u2019s vice president for another period of eight years from 1993 to 2000. He was nominated as the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate in 2000 but lost the presidential election to George W. Bush in what is regarded as one of the closest presidential contests in history. So close was the election result that there was a dispute over a vote recount in Florida which was resolved by the Supreme Court 5-4 in favour of Bush. Since Gore was determined to use public office to achieve public good, he did not allow the setback in his plan to define him, he moved on to other things and still achieved public good outside public office. After exiting the presidency, he moved into environmental advocacy, which had been his passion since his undergraduate years in Harvard. He established the Alliance for Climate Protection, which called the attention of the world to the reality of climate change and the danger of neglecting this. In 2006, he released a documentary titled, An Inconvenient Truth. He later wrote a book on the same theme. For his efforts in drawing attention to the grave danger posed by climate challenge, Gore was, in 2007, awarded the Nobel Prize (jointly with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). He also won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2009 for the book version of An Inconvenient Truth. From being just a statesman, Gore moved on to become a global citizen and thought leader after his plan to lead his country as the president failed.  Many of the people who end up as failures are of the belief that the system in which they have found themselves is against them, which is why things don\u2019t go well with them. Rather than take time to analyse the situation with a view to getting a solution, they resort to blame game; they blame everyone and everything in sight for their woes. But blaming others does not solve any problem. Problems become a thing of the past when the right strategy is deployed. Bill Gates\u2019 first attempt in business was not quite successful. Gates, in partnership with Paul Allen and Paul Gilbert, started Traf-O-Data in 1970, a company which read raw data from roadway traffic counters and used same to create reports for traffic engineers. While the business recorded modest success at the beginning, its fate was sealed when the State of Washington offered free traffic processing services to cities, thus putting an end to the need for private service providers. With that, the business was out of business. But instead of lamenting the government policy which put them out of business, Gates and Allen moved to something else. They used the demise of Traf-O-Data as the launching pad for Microsoft. Today, the whole world is better for it.  No man can be better or greater than his beliefs.

The awards and recognitions, a recent Fitch Ratings and The Banker awards are testimonials of FirstBank\u2019s determination to remain at the top. Most industry analysts believe that Fitch\u2019s rerating of FirstBank aligns with ratings of other global agencies (such as S&P: B- with a stable outlook; Moodys: B2 with stable outlook) \u2013 a double confirmation of what industry peers already acknowledge \u2013 back to leading the pack.  First Bank under the leadership of Adesola Adeduntan, has ensured the lender keeps the trust of Nigerians gained over many years of its enduring legacy of safety and security. The bank\u2019s customer accounts have grown from about 10 million in 2015 to over 36 million (including digital wallets). The bank is also the second-largest issuer of cards in Africa with over 11.8 million issued cards, and onboard over 18.6 million active customers on FirstBank\u2019s digital banking platforms. For Adeduntan, at the heart of an agile and resilient business is technology-enabled innovation that allows organisations to stay ahead of the curve. \u201cThe banking industry is very dynamic,\u201d he says in an article published by KPMG, a multinational professional services network, and one of the Big Four accounting organisations. Adeduntun added, \u201cNo one knows precisely how the industry will evolve, but we do know that technology will continue to play a critical role. As an industry leader, we must remain innovative to stay ahead of the market.\u201d \u201cEverything is about technology today; it is closely interwoven with our business. We see digital as an opportunity, an irreversible evolution. FirstBank was an early adopter and we continue to expand our digital frontiers, like embracing cloud solutions. In fact, for us, the rule for new solutions is \u2018cloud first,\u201d Adeduntun said. Last month, Fitch Ratings upgraded the ratings of FBNH signifying its confidence in the financial conglomerate. According to Fitch in the rating statement, the upgrade of the Long-Term IDRs follows that of the VRs, reflecting that corporate governance irregularities publicly raised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in April 2021, including two longstanding related-party exposures, have largely been addressed. For FBN Holdings and First Bank PLC, the Viability Ratings (VR) were upgraded to \u2018B\u2019 from \u2018B-\u2019. \u2018\u2019Fitch equally upgraded the issuers\u2019 National Long-Term Ratings to A (nga) from BBB (nga), reflecting their improved creditworthiness relative to that of other issuers in Nigeria\u2019\u2019 and highlighted the critical role of the following in its upgrade of both FBNHoldings and FirstBank\u2019s ratings: A strong franchise; Improved asset quality;Healthy profitability; Improved capitalisation; Stable funding profile; ESG considerations. The Top 100 African Bank Rankings 2022 recently released by The Banker Magazine from the stables of Financial Times shows FirstBank leading the Nigerian table in four areas, the highest achieved by any Nigerian bank. The rankings, based on the end of year 31 December 2021 audited financials of all banks in the Top 100, reveal FirstBank\u2019s ranking as number one in Nigeria in terms of: Overall Performance; Profitability; Efficiency and Return on Risk. Stating that corporate governance issues have been addressed, Fitch said \u201caccording to management, the two related-party exposures highlighted by the CBN, which included equity and credit exposures to two companies of whom FBNH\u2019s previous chairman was also chairman, have largely been disposed of and repaid. \u201cFitch understands from management that FBNH and FBN have not been subject to penalties in relation to irregularities raised by the CBN in April 2021 and no further irregularities have been raised,\u201d it stated. The rating agency also noted that First Bank of Nigeria (FBN) the commercial arm of FBNH, impaired loans ratio has declined significantly to 5.6 per cent as at the end of the first half of 2022 from a peak of 25 per cent at the end of the 2018 financial year as a result of sizeable write-offs, successful restructurings and recoveries. In Euromoney Market Leaders, an independent global assessment of the leading financial service providers conducted by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc., the Bank was crowned: Market Leader: (tier-1 recognition) in Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR); Market Leader: (tier -1 recognition) Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG); Highly Regarded: in Corporate Banking and Digital Solutions and Notable: in SME Banking.  On the profitability, Fitch said \u201cFBNH delivers healthy profitability, as indicated by an operating return on risk-weighted assets (RWAs) averaging 2.6 per cent over the past four years from four per cent in 2021, underpinned by large recoveries on a previously written-off loan. Earnings benefit from a low cost of funding and strong non-interest income but are constrained by a high cost-to-income ratio of 74 per cent in 2021 and significant loan impairment charges (LICs) in recent years.\u201d Asides this it said on funding, \u201cFBN\u2019s customer deposit base, which is 76 per cent of total funding at end- 1H22) comprises a high share of retail deposits (64 per cent at end-2021) and current and savings accounts (81 per cent at end-1H22), supporting funding stability and a low cost of funding. Depositor concentration is fairly low. Liquidity coverage is comfortable in local and foreign currencies.  The agency further explained, \u201cFBNH\u2019s and FBN\u2019s Environmental Sustainability and Governance (ESG) Relevance Score for corporate governance has been changed to \u20183\u2019 from \u20184\u2019, reflecting our view that corporate governance irregularities publicly raised by the CBN have been addressed without penalty and therefore the factor is no longer relevant to their ratings.\u201d The fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCCR) measures a firm\u2019s ability to cover its fixed charges, such as debt payments, interest expense, and equipment lease expense. The rating note also pointed out the improved capitalisation of the holding company saying its \u201cFCC ratio of 19.1 per cent as at end-H1, 2022 has been on an upward trend in recent years, as a result of strong internal capital generation, which has been influenced by a modest dividend payout ratio. \u201cImpaired loans net of specific loan loss allowances has declined as a share of FCC in recent years to a moderate 12 per cent at end-H1 2022. Pre-impairment operating profit is sizeable (an annualised 5.1 per cent of average gross loans in 1H22), providing a reasonable buffer to absorb LICs without affecting capital. \u201cFBNH\u2019s and FBN\u2019s ESG Relevance Score for corporate governance has been changed to \u20183\u2019 from \u20184\u2019, reflecting our view that corporate governance irregularities publicly raised by the CBN have been addressed without penalty and therefore the factor is no longer relevant to their ratings. \u201cFitch has also upgraded the issuers\u2019 National Long-Term Ratings to \u2018A(nga)\u2019 from \u2018BBB(nga)\u2019, reflecting their improved creditworthiness relative to that of other issuers in Nigeria.\u201d  FirstBank is constantly working to deliver short and long-term value for our stakeholders by building a solid Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) culture and continuously engaging with and communicating its activities to them. It is in this way that the Bank creates mutually beneficial business opportunities and outcomes for its stakeholders. FirstBank\u2019s long-term approach to sustainability includes minimising its direct and indirect impact on the environment. This has informed its efforts at conserving energy to reduce global warming by reducing our CO2 emissions, as well as conserving resources With a standard Environmental Social and Governance Management System in place, FirstBank has been employing international best practice tools to manage risks in the lending process. For example, in H1 2022, over 2.2 trillion-naira worth of transactions were screened for ESG risks. As part of its Climate initiative, FirstBank is partnering with National Conservation Foundation on the Green Recovery Nigeria (GRN) \u2013 an initiative which includes driving afforestation and reforestation.\u00a0 Forest resources provide employment for two million people and tree planting is one of the most effective ways of tackling climate change caused by greenhouse gas. FirstBank community development initiatives are anchored on its strategic pillar of Education, Health and Welfare. The FirstBank Corporate Responsibility &Sustainability (CR&S) week is a dedicated week that offers employees opportunities to give their time and resources to defined causes in line with FirstBank\u2019s CR&S strategic approach. The Week\u2019s activities are an aspect of FirstBank\u2019s Employee Giving and Volunteering Programme, which was instituted with the aim of encouraging employees to give back to the community as well as inculcate in them the integral corporate culture of giving. FirstBank held the maiden edition of the CR&S Week in 2017 with a focus mainly on Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness (SPARK) initiative. The initiative focuses on creating and reinforcing the attitude of going beyond just meeting the material needs of people, who are unable to help themselves, to showing compassion, empathy and civility.In 2022 CR&S week, the achievements include 30,000 underprivileged lives including women touched; 7million people reached with kindness message and 421 took kindness pledge partnering with over 80 NGOs and charities in over eight countries acrossSub -Sahara Africa and UK.  Euromoney Market Leaders also ranked the bank as Highly Regarded in Corporate Banking and Digital Solutions and Notable in SME Banking. Earlier this year been named Best Banking Digital Transformation Nigeria at the International Investor Awards 2022, in recognition of its continued efforts at reinventing its digital banking channels which have been central to reinforcing the Bank\u2019s leading role in promoting a cashless society in the country whilst putting customers at an advantage in enjoying a secured and seamless digital banking experiences. It was also recognised with the Best Bank in Nigeria 2022 award for its leadership role in promoting financial inclusion in Nigeria, which has been integral to improving lives and stimulating businesses of individuals across the country. First Bank is still taking the lead in financial inclusion drive in the country with its 750 business locations and over 180,000 Banking Agents including 55,000 female FirstMonie agents spread across the 774 Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Besides these, the bank has been handy at promoting digital payment in the country and has issued over 10 million cards, the first bank to achieve such a milestone in the country. FirstBank\u2019s cashless transaction drive extends to having more than 10 million people on its USSD Quick Banking service through the nationally renowned *894# Banking code and over 4.5 million people on FirstMobile platform.

The one-day training held last Wednesday, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, was organised by the Federal Government agency, in collaboration with the State Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment to ensure increase in the volume of processed cocoa being exported from Nigeria to our countries. The South West Zonal Coordinator of NEPC, Samuel Oyeyipo, while addressing the cocoa farmers drawn across the state and other stakeholders, lamented decrease in production of cocoa in the country. He noted that Nigeria produces 250,000 metric tonnes per annum against 800,000 and 2,000,000 metric tonnes produced by Ghana and Ivory Coast annually. Oyeyipo said the training was part of the Council\u2019s effort at helping stakeholders involved in the cocoa value chain scale up the production, processing, and marketing. While urging cocoa farmers to take advantage of the large mass land and population to scale up production. The theme of the one -day training was \u201cRepositioning Nigeria\u2019s Cocoa Beans for Increased Global Competitiveness\u201d. In his remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Olu-Ola Aikulola, who spoke on Value Chain Export Development (VCED) for Cocoa stakeholders hinted that the shift from agriculture to oil in the 60s had negatively affected the exportation of cocoa in the country. He pointed out that Nigeria had greatly benefitted from agriculture in developing the country years back, while re-emphasising the need to revive cocoa production to salvage the economy. Aikulola lauded the NEPC for its efforts at boosting non-oil exports, while calling on the participants to utilise the knowledge gained to improve their businesses. The Chairman, Cocoa Association of Nigeria, Ogun State chapter, Mr. Olusesan Sowunmi, commended NEPC for the training, saying it would impact on farmers and other stakeholders on planting, harvesting, processing, and marketing of their products both locally and internationally.

{"headline": "\u2018High quality, pure seeds key to attainment of food sufficiency, security in Nigeria\u2019", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2067-scaled-e1666056343285.jpeg", "author": "Ifedayo Ogunyemi", "posted_date": "Oct 18, 2022", "description": "The Vice Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Professor Timothy Adebayo, has harped on the need for farmers in the country to use high quality and pure seeds as part of efforts to help the country attain food sufficiency and security which are central to human\u2019s existence and survival. He stated this while encouraging the government to give private investors a breeding ground to operate in order to meet the nation\u2019s current demand for high quality seeds. Professor Adebayo stated this during a sensitisation workshop for farmers in Oyo town and stakeholders on the newly-established agric venture of the university, ACU Seeds Ltd, held at the university campus in Oyo town. Besides the theoretical knowledge acquired from the conventional classroom, Adebayo who was represented by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Prof Muyiwa Popoola, urged other tertiary institutions to push for technocracy, digital literacy and entrepreneurial skills, which will make their students self-reliant. \u201cHowever, fine seeds are rare in that they are not easily accessible and not in the right or needed quantity. Farmers have been grappling with using low quality and impure seeds that portend grave dangers to crop production and food security. \u201cAlthough farmers could procure high quality seeds from agricultural research institutes in Nigeria, these seeds were barely enough to meet the huge needs which can lead to expected significant economic impacts. Individual companies and private institutions should be allowed to venture into seed business in order for the production to meet the existing demand in the country. \u201cThe government eventually acceded to the yearnings of farmers and farm enterprises on March 3, 2021 by passing into law the Plant Variety Protection (PVP) bill. The PVP law affords private seed breeders the opportunity to brand their breeds of seeds and claim intellectual property rights on them. The breeders can then commercialise their new breeds in large quantities to farmers across the country. \u201cThroughout the world, the seed business is a multi-million dollar enterprise which can enhance the economic growth of private individuals, businesses and that of a nation. It is just apt for us in Ajayi Crowther University to venture into it, given our ready affection for agriculture and its various businesses,\u201d Prof Adebayo said. Also speaking at the event, Dean of the Faculty\u00a0 of Agriculture, Prof Babatunde Akanbi, pointed that while ACU Seeds Ltd has been incorporated by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), the venture is going through the accreditation process with the National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), Abuja. \u201cLet it be on record that IITA gave (free) ACU 350 kg breeder seeds of two newly released maize varieties bio-fortified with provitamin A (PVA). Records showed that this quantity of this class of seed had never been given to anybody or institution in Nigeria. That is how ACU Seeds Business started its success journey,\u201d he added. While noting that the objectives of ACU Seed business is not limited to production of maize seed varieties, Prof Akanbi listed the items of interest to include legal production, processing, packaging and marketing of certified arable crop seeds of maize, cowpea, soybean, rice; certified stem cuttings for crops like cassava, etc; suckers of pineapple, exotic improved banana and plantain, etc. Others are tree crop seedlings like cocoa, budded citrus, grafted mango, white jumbo guava, dwarf and local pawpaw, etc; forest tree seedlings like teak, gmelina, soursop, passion fruits, jack fruits, etc; planting propagules of special/spices crops like gingers, rhizomes, garlic, scent leaf, onion, etc and many others that will be added in the course of the seed business operations. The NASC DG who was represented by Adekunle Adesegba, a regional director in the commission, urged ACU to fund the venture well enough for it to succeed. \u201cThe big market for ACU is the tree and horticultural sector. It has not been tapped into. I encourage you to tap into it and get its benefits. We will collaborate with ACU to export seeds and reduce the proliferation of quackery. We will be with you all the way,\u201d he said. Wende Mengesha who represented the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Maize Breeder, Dr Abebe Menkir, pointed out that the most important way to succeed in the business is to produce high quality seeds, saying that \u201cthere is no plan B to seed quality. We encourage ACU to keep the standard up.\u201d The ACU plant breeder who spoke on \u201cSeed: A Microcosm of Life and Driver of Jumbo Crop Harvest\u201d called for collaboration from stakeholders to produce high quality seeds to meet the demands of the farmers.

It has disrupted world peace, many unexpectedly lost their lives and governments worldwide, individually, and collectively, have been busy innovating on how to tackle the menace that caused a global decline in trade and tightened financial situation. But as normalcy began to creep in, a \u2018lunatic\u2019 adventurist, Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, invaded a sovereign nation, Ukraine, and put a break on all efforts made at recovery. He further plunged the world into economic abyss. His enterprise attracted global condemnation and reactions in form of economic sanctions causing disruption in energy, oil, and food supply chains. Worse hit were the emerging economies like Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s case is peculiar being a monoculture economy. It could be recall that at the outset of the global pandemic, the Nigeria government rose to the occasion deploying both monetary and fiscal policies to mitigate the effect of the crisis. The Central Bank of Nigeria at the time, deployed a multi-faceted intervention it named targeted credit facility for households, SMEs, and the real sector, including the health sector to enable them undertake research, and strengthen the sectors. The Central Bank of Nigeria made available a-N9.3trillion stimulus package. The effort enabled the economy during the crisis to exit economic recession within quarters. However, the Russia-Ukraine imbroglio has brought unprecedented inflationary spike globally, coupled with monetary policy tightening policy by the US Federal Reserves that has also pressured the Naira. The Governor of the CBN, Mr Godwin Emefiele alluded to this at the end of the Bank\u2019s 287th Monetary Policy Committee meeting. But Nigeria\u2019s situation is peculiar and complex. Insecurity, banditry, infrastructure decay, power challenge, crude oil theft, corruption, and above all, capital flight from the economy as investors continued to leave in droves due to strangulating economic climate, are among the reasons the Naira is battered. In fact, there has been no new foreign investment in the country in the last five years. Several International Oil Companies (IOCs) have left the country accounting also for the shortfall in crude oil production and revenue.\u00a0 The security situation is frightening. Kidnapping for ransom is closing doors to fresh investments. The Diaspora remittances vent is fast drying out. The Diasporas are no longer safe with their investments back home, either they were robbed or killed by bandits, thus creating a big hole in forex inflow that helps in foreign reserves accretion. The country is also burdened with huge debt. Inflation rate is trending at 20.52 per cent, and hunger reigns in the land. This, and many more, may have informed the decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee members to hike the rates in response to the spiking inflation rate. The Bank at its last meeting increased Monetary Police Rate (MPR) by 150 basis points, from 14 to 15 per cent, being the baseline interest rate in any economy, and on it rests other interest rates. As the 2023 general elections beckons, and very characteristic of Nigerian politicians, the Naira may not fare better. Monies not within the bank vaults are flying around, and more would be on the streets for electioneering campaigns. Foreign currencies were used to woo and pay delegates during the political parties\u2019 primaries, and during campaigns and elections proper, it would be worse. Politicians have been busy mopping up dollars at the parallel market, as Naira exchanges between N670 \u2013 N730/$1. The CBN\u2019s MPC may have elected to act in earnest with rate hike action to mop up money in circulation and arrest the flying inflation before the real political campaigns begin. With this measure however, and in flagrant disobedient to extant electoral laws forbidding reckless, and extravagant spending during electioneering campaigns, the unrestrained and desperate Nigerian politician would not care about what becomes of the economy, and the Naira. And with the looming global economic recession, the CBN\u2019s MPC may have done what a Yoruba adage admonishes \u2018What an elder see, sitting down, cannot be seen by a young person even when standing on top of a tree.\u2019 Though the decision was received with mixed feelings by various stakeholders, unbiasedly and objectively, it was the best decision for the moment. The poor must be rescued from the clutches of hunger; Naira must regain its breath and true value. The politicians should realise that the Naira, our symbol of identity and heritage, must be protected from economic vampires and the government must intensify its effort in eliminating banditry, and kidnapping in the country. It is hurting the economy. This menace has deprived local farmers who took loans from the banks access to their farmlands and driven foreign investors out of the economy. Crude oil, the nation\u2019s major means of forex receipt, has been an albatross riddled in controversies \u2013 theft, low production (not meeting production quota) et al. The situation has become an international embarrassment to Nigerians. While other oil producing nations have been smiling home, declaring billions of dollars in profits, Nigeria is rocked with debt as it has nothing to profit from. This menace has deprived the country from meeting its allocated quota by the OPEC, and the projected revenue. The government, if not complicit in the quagmire, must act decisively and rescue the economy from bankruptcy. As the 2023 general elections are here, it is incumbent on the fiscal and the monetary authority to align strongly to save the economy. The fiscal authority has not really done enough like its monetary counterpart, and it is that absence the CBN has been filling which had been erroneously misconstrued as a usurpation of mandate. The Naira is under siege, lets rescue it. The fate of the Naira is also rooted in overdependence on crude oil for sustenance.\u00a0 And what the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele has been advocating as panacea to the problem is economic diversification. Economic diversification to agriculture and non-oil products. Nigeria has had a glorious era in agriculture, and a return to it will not hurt. For this singular reason was why pressure was brought to bear on the nation\u2019s external reserves and the resultant serial devaluation of the Naira in recent times. And given the country\u2019s propensity for anything foreign i.e almost importing all her needs, there is little Godwin Emefiele, and his team can do to save the Naira, except the government takes the first step, leading by example, and thereafter encourage Nigerians to start \u2018patronising and buy made-in-Nigeria products to grow the Naira.\u2019 ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "business", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/we-must-rescue-naira/"},

Corporate social responsibility therefore isn\u2019t only about a particular programme, it\u2019s what we do every day, maximising positive impact and minimising negative impact.\u201d This assertion was the key take-out at the 2013 Responsible Business Summit in London and it aptly captures FirstBank\u2019s philosophy about business, environment, people and society. First Bank of Nigeria Limited is a firm believer in spreading the milk of kindness through the basic daily interactions and not waiting for the big show. The financial giant is driven by the maxim that creating a strong business and building a better world are not conflicting goals; they are both essential ingredients for long-term success. Over time, the bank has evolved strategies that enabled it to thrive and blossom as a business interest while at the same time providing essential benefits to various sectors and sections of the society through innovation, consistency and genuine advocacy. Recall that during the COVID-19 pandemic which ravaged the world, FirstBank was a key force in the Nigerian private sector led Coalition Against COVID -19 (CACOVID) group through which it provided palliative food packages to combat widespread hunger, and robust e-learning platform for one million students amongst other strategic interventions. This aligns with its mantra of being woven into the fabrics of the society and not just a commercial interest. As a business that thinks beyond \u2018profit making\u2019 and \u2018profit maximization\u2019 by incorporating corporate ethics and contributes to the society at large, through its well defined corporate social responsibility policy, the company is one that is poised to withstand the test of time and meet sustainable growth in the market having operated for over 128 years. To deepen the practice and entrench the culture of showing kindness to all, FirstBank established the annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability week. The nation\u2019s premier banking institution leverages the opportunity to showcase and rally its corporate social investment engagements. The yearly CR&S Week is a dedicated week designed to offer FirstBank staff, customers and the public opportunities to demonstrate the milk of human kindness that flows in them and give their time and resources to defined causes. It seeks to amplify FirstBank\u2019s innate culture of giving and volunteering as embodied in its Employee Giving and Volunteering. As FirstBank gears up for its 2022 CR&S Week scheduled to hold between August 22 and 26, it promises to feature a bouquet of life touching activities and engagements that will translate to far reaching results and impacts through numerous touch points including schools, healthcare, orphanages, widow support groups and others. The initiative will be rolled out across Nigeria and other Africa countries where FirstBank is located through its subsidiary; FBNBank. These subsidiaries include, FBNBank in the DR Congo, Ghana, The Gambia, Guinea, Sierra-Leone, UK, Senegal. Speaking ahead of the forthcoming programmes, the Bank\u2019s Global Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications, Folake Ani-Mumuney, said the week was set aside to reignite acts of kindness in our society and the events are tailored towards re-orientating the society along the right values; encouraging the citizenry to intentionally create positive impact in their immediate environment. \u201cFrom the inaugural edition in 2017, the programme has been a reflection of FirstBank\u2019s brand promise to always put its customers first while reinforcing the Bank\u2019s role in driving sustainable development in the communities where it operates\u201d She noted. In 2017, FirstBank had kick started the CR&S Week innovation between 25 \u2013 29 September 2017 as the first of its kind in the financial sector and has since not slowed down. The historical inaugural FirstBank CR&S week themed \u2018Promoting Kindness; Putting You First\u2019 witnessed the culmination of the bank\u2019s interventions in social responsibility, promoting random acts of kinds across communities in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria and FirstBank subsidiaries in United Kingdom and sub-Saharan Africa. One of the major highlights of the week has been dubbed the SPARK initiative originally translated as Staff Promoting Acts of Random Kindness. It was later changed to S.P.A.R.K which now stands for Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness. Though originally the \u201cS\u201d stood for \u201cStaff\u201d. It was changed to \u201cStart\u201d to broaden the initiative beyond just staff and encourage everyone else to be part of the kindness brigade. Also, \u201cP\u201d originally stood for \u201cPromoting\u201d but was changed to \u201cPerforming\u201d to convey the sense that participants are equally involved in actually doing kind acts and not only promoting kindness. The week-long activities saw the bank\u2019s employees giving time and resources to promote random acts of kindness within their communities, driving welfare through giving and visits to orphanage/less privileged homes and IDPs. The bank\u2019s executive management also had career counselling and financial literacy sessions with secondary school students. Another key highlight was the nomination of Baby Ijeoma as a beneficiary of corrective heart surgery in India in partnership with Vama Wave Foundation. The impact of the first edition went beyond Nigeria as FirstBank\u2019s subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa and the UK also participated, benefitting people and at least 22 charities in six countries. In 2018, the event progressed. Themed \u2018Touching Lives; You First\u2019, it was also utilised to give time and resources in the service of humanity. Going a notch higher, it focused on five key initiatives, including impacting over 10,000 senior secondary school students on financial literacy and independence via the FutureFirst programme, providing vision screening and eye glasses for 10,000 low-income earners in partnership with VisionSpring, empowerment for over 500 widows through provision of start-up capital and capacity building as part of the UN International Widows\u2019 Day commemoration in partnership with International Women\u2019s Society (IWS) in Lagos, staff needs assessment and donation to 26 charities across eight countries as well as the SPARK initiative during the second edition between June 19 \u2013 23. During the commemoration, Dr Adesola Adeduntan, the bank\u2019s Managing Director, speaking at Yaba College of Technology Secondary School, said the week-long event was the bank\u2019s brand promise to always put stakeholders\u2019 needs first. He reiterated the initiative as a move to reinforce the bank\u2019s role in driving sustainable development in the communities where it operates. In 2019, the CR&S Week held from July 1 \u2013 6, 2019 with the theme \u201cRipples of Kindness: Putting You First.\u201d The theme was informed by the bank\u2019s belief that every act of kindness (regardless of how little or in whatever form) ignites a ripple effect that goes on without end. The year\u2019s CR&S Week focused mainly on the SPARK initiative, which had gained significant attention. The edition also featured visits to schools \u2013 secondary schools across Nigeria \u2013 where students were educated on acts of kindness, encouraging them to make kindness a lifestyle. The regular activities were also retained in 2019, including visits to orphanages/less privilege homes and widows\u2019 empowerment in collaboration with International Women\u2019s Society (IWS) Nigeria to empower a select number of widows across Nigeria. The implementation in Nigeria covered the six geopolitical zones with activities held in four states per zone, amounting to 24 states in all. Six subsidiaries of FirstBank also implemented the programme in their markets/countries \u2013 UK, Ghana, DRC, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Senegal. In all, 25 schools benefitted with 6,000 students participating in terms of the School Engagement; 50 charities and NGOs, including Leap Africa and IWS, were partnered. Over 20,000 orphans/less privilege people including widows were also reached. In 2020, there was no formal ceremony due to Covid-19 movement and health restrictions yet FirstBank didn\u2019t stop its demonstration of kindness to all. To minimise the disruption to children\u2019s education, ensuring that they remained fully engaged during the difficult period and are not left behind by their peers across the world, FirstBank produced a brilliant e-learning intervention. Working with partners, such as IBM, Robert & John, Curious Learning and the Lagos State Government, it launched an e-Learning Initiative designed to move one million children onto safe online learning platform.

{"headline": "Every profession has its challenges, so also Nollywood \u2014Oba Opoor", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Aramide1.jpg", "author": "ADERONKE ADESANYA", "posted_date": "Oct 15, 2022", "description": "  Growing up was fun as I was affectionately nurtured by my parents in Lagos. I attended Goshen Nursery and Primary School before proceeding to Evans Adelaja in Bariga. Although, I later finished from Goshen International College when the school opened a branch in Ikorodu. It was a missionary school and you should not be surprised, it is because I am from a Christian home and my parents are very religious. I completed my National Diploma from the Nigeria Institute of Journalism, Ogba, Lagos. I had my Industrial Training in TVC and went for my Bachelor of Science in Mass Communication at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State.  Talking about your career, what led\u00a0you to the Nollywood industry? How did you get into the industry? For me, acting has been a craft that I have been passionate about from time immemorial. Whenever I watched\u00a0home videos in my formative years, I so much adored thespians that I got determined from a tender age that I would make it my career. By the time I got the opportunity to become one, I spoke to a close friend and my friend encouraged me to enroll for a training in the field so that I would become a professional. I learned the arts and craft from the Eagles Caucasus (under the tutelage of Mr Okikiola Afolayan) for two years before I started my own production.  As mentioned earlier, I delved into acting as a result of my undying passion for it. And I\u2019m delighted that I settled for the option as there has been no regret so far.\u00a0Of course, during my formative years, I was always featuring in drama both at school and in the church. All of those made me passionate about the job.  Incontestably, it has not been easy being in the industry. No doubt, every field has its own challenges, similarly, acting does too. But I keep going as a result of my passion for it. It is easy for an audience to dismiss a movie as unreasonable but it only takes a professional to know what has gone into any production psychologically, physically, financially and so on. Well, as I would always say, our job is our audience, thus, my passion for the job keeps me going when challenges surface.  Aside from acting, I\u2019m into make-up as I am a certified make-up artist\u00a0and also an entrepreneur. However, none of them compares to acting for me.  I am still in the process.\u00a0And of course, it\u00a0has\u00a0not\u00a0been\u00a0bad.\u00a0\u00a0All glory to God Almighty, we\u00a0are doing fine.  My production goes like every other good production. I think of a story line. I research into it and do other needful things to ensure it is rich enough for my audience to learn from.  There are a lot of people I look up to in the industry. The list is endless. I would not love to mention names but be assured I have mentors and role models in the industry.  For me, this year in the industry has been an amazing one so far. I only pray to have better years ahead. I only look up to more profitable productions and endorsements in the forthcoming years.  Warisi Omo Baba Landlord 1&2,\u00a0 Naija Christmas, Cameo role,\u00a0which is on\u00a0Netflix,\u00a0Played\u00a0Posh\u00a0in the movie ENIYARA,\u00a0OLOSHO GHETTO,\u00a0Omo Baba Olowo Obo,\u00a0SUNAMIIII\u00a0,\u00a0Ile\u00a0Alayo the series,\u00a0Omo\u00a0Yahoo,\u00a0Oosha Aje,\u00a0Rotten potatoes and many more.  Well, I give am A-performance in any role assigned to me. So far, I have no dream roles. I only want to be a versatile actress whom any great movie maker would be delighted to work with.  I am always open to receiving feedbacks, whether it\u2019s positive or constructive criticism. I find that when I take in all of the information my director gives me, I can use it to improve my performance. When working with a director or producer, I try to be as prepared as possible so they don\u2019t have to give me many directions during filming. This helps them focus on other actors who may need more help.  Nollywood is another class entirely. We do not only learn from the four walls of the school, we also learn through discussions, movies among others. Consequently, Nollywood is a teaching tool on many fronts.  Undoubtedly, a good actor must have a good memory as you wouldn\u2019t have your script with you when you deliver your lines.\u00a0I have excellent memory skills and interpersonal skills, which help me learn lines quickly and work with cast members and directors smoothly. I would describe my acting style as natural. I believe that when performing, we should act like ourselves rather than trying to be someone else. This allows me to connect with the audience and other actors easily because they feel like they are watching real people rather than characters. It also helps me stay focused on the performance rather than worrying about remembering lines. I am thrilled with the progress of my acting career. I am proud of my accomplishments and the path my career has taken so far.\u00a0I\u00a0have met some incredible people in the acting industry, and this network has helped me succeed in a tremendous way. I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m most comfortable when sticking to the script, however, I do enjoy improvising during rehearsals or if we need to change something on set. There\u2019s always room for improvisation. Improvisation is a useful theatrical tool.  I would be delighted to change the\u00a0\u201cAunty Aunty, brother\u201d\u00a0syndrome in the industry. In a formal and professional circle, the line of\u00a0\u201cAunty, brother\u201d\u00a0thing is blurred. That I address you by your first name doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have reverence for you. Conscientiously working together and genuine love should be the ultimate aims.  Aside from the fact that I am a diligent person, I ensure that excellence is the hallmark of whatever I do. Those two things, my tenacity of purpose and my readiness to unlearn, learn and re-learn things\u00a0stand me out amidst competition.  In five years time, I pray to see myself appearing in award-wining movies.  I believe both are important, but I think it can be beneficial to spend more time focusing on training than raw talent because it\u2019s a great way to improve and keep learning new techniques, which can open you to more projects.  I would describe my personality as outgoing and energetic. I love being on stage and performing for an audience, which is why I got into acting in the first place. However, I\u2019m also very empathetic and compassionate, which helps me connect with other people and understand their emotions. This has helped me develop many friendships with fellow actors.  People tend not to believe that I\u2019m a jovial person. I\u2019m extremely playful. They mistake me for an\u00a0\u201cover-serious\u201d\u00a0person, which is laughable.  I\u2019m working on something that will be a blockbuster. My fans should watch out.  If you have a dream, go for it. In as much as you can dream it, you can achieve it. Be prayerful and don\u2019t give up! Giving up should be deleted from your dictionary. I love them all.

I\u2019ve been through few learning stages, which I\u2019ve initiated into my craft to bring out the best which represents my brand name, \u201cAFROGENIUS\u201d but it\u2019s been interesting so far. I actually found out I was in love with music at age 7, then I joined the choir at age 9 and ever since it has been something I loved doing a lot which made me enhance my talent to become an artiste in 2016. At this stage, I was only going to studio sessions learning how people record and all that. I found out that my former name was too boring, so I decided to spice it up. One morning, I woke up, took a pen and a note book and started writing different names and I came up with Molazzi, which I found interesting, I looked at the internet I found out no one had that name as an artiste, then Boom! \u2013 Molazzi. AfroGenius! \u2013 The feel and not just the voice or the vibe, we have different genres of music today in the industry, which has made a lot of styles of music come into play. One thing I know about a good sound is that it must surely find a way into your soul, where\u00a0 the \u201cAFROGENIUS\u201d sound comes in, be it an EDM music, Dancehall riddim, Afrobeats or any kind of genre . The sound must always find its way into your soul. Beautiful, black melanin women. The song appreciates the beauty and vibe of black women, women made from the soil of Africa.  I\u2019m currently independent. Right now, the market is selling fast on Amapiano sounds as well as AfroEDM and I would love to feel that space too. there\u2019s just something special about that sound, especially the right time the piano comes in and I\u2019ve worked with a few producers on these type of sounds. There are these Amapiano brothers called SMEEZ & D3an, I met them through an AnR in the United Kingdom (UK) called, DAISYMAE, she heard \u2018vaccine\u2019 and loved it. And while vibing to it on her page on Instagram Smeez reached out to her to make a second dose to vaccine. we\u2019ve got few other sounds we\u2019ve made after then. There are times when we work and not get paid, most times in sessions and few other stuffs. There are lots of challenges in the industry daily and part of the big issue is funding. There are so many talents out there who don\u2019t have access to the right funding, but I\u2019m glad to see how the Nigerian music industry has improved to become a sky for every talent.  Everyone has a story of how they grew up, especially in the streets of Lagos. I grew up in a really strict Christian family. I grew up in Bariga, Lagos State, in a family of five, of which I\u2019m the last born. It\u2019s been a hell of a journey growing up with parents and siblings who never wanted to see you do music, especially when your Dad has a role to play in the church. I got kicked out of the house several times due to disobedience by always going to the studio. Despite the challenges, I had made consistency my personal adviser and friend. In 2015, I won a rap completion oraganised by MTN at the University of Lagos (UNILAG),that would later convince my dad a bit about me taking up music as a career. He knew somehow I really loved it and I was too stubborn to let go.  So many things have changed except me, so many lessons have been learnt and as well so many heights and characters have been achieved.  I have few sounds dropping this year probably by September; you would all get the new sound and as well have other sounds dropping before December, Of course, sure I\u2019m open to collaboration and I\u2019m as well on a good collaboration with a partner of mine called \u201cMansaCole\u201d, great stuffs on the way. Sure there is one special great entertainer I would love to be like, which is Molazzi, he is such a talented beast.  Sounds, waters and evening walks. I get inspiration from old school musical acts, like Angelique Kidjo, Lijadu Sisters. Fela Anikulapo Kuti and other great legends as well as new school artistes too, with likes of Olamide, Burnaboy, Wizkid, Jon Bellion, Postmalone, Kranium and the rest of other acts in the game.  I promise not to get stingy with my sounds from now on, love you all, never stop praying!

My late mother was also a captain of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C & S) Church. I hail from Ijebu Ode, Ogun State and I have been a member of the C&S since1969. I attended African Methodist School and Anglican Modern School for my primary and modern schools respectively. Later, I went to a nursing school, and upon graduation; I worked for 20 years as a nurse.  I don\u2019t eat much heavy food. I exercise once in a while, I take lots of fruits and vegetables and I rest well.  That I\u2019m still very agile. Going to locations, modelling\u00a0 and advertising as an ambassador are all parts of exercising, which have helped me to remain smart. But like I always say, it is the grace of God, staying healthy at such an age is God\u2019s gift. It is by the grace of God that I am still relevant in the industry. When it is God\u2019s time and He has decided to help you, there is nothing anyone else can do. When I was younger, I never knew I could be this relevant. I realised my popularity when I was 50 years old, but I pray that the younger ones would never go through the kind of ordeal I experienced before making it to stardom.  I started as a stage actress in my late husband\u2019s Osumare Theatre Group. Even while I was working as a nurse, I still found time to go to locations. At 45, in 1986, I retired from nursing on the advice of the late Chief Hubert Ogunde. He (Ogunde) reasoned that since my husband died in 1984, there was a need for me to continue with the family legacy. So, I went into acting full-time. It was not easy at first, because I was formerly a salary earner. In fact, the first set of movies I acted in was; \u201cAje ni Iya Mi\u201d and \u201cEru\u201d. My late husband\u2019s group was called Osumare Theatre, meaning \u2018rainbow\u2019. One day, I went to act with some white men and in the course of acting, someone asked for the meaning of Osumare and I replied rainbow. Then he said I should henceforth be called Iya Rainbow and that was it. I have produced lots of movies like \u201cAlamose Eniyan\u201d, \u201cAlepo Rebi\u201d, \u201cAnikolapo\u201d, \u201cOmodupe\u201d \u201cOluwa\u201d, \u201cOrisa Rebi\u201d among others, but I have acted in over 500 movies.  It is the issue of piracy and marketers. Some marketers are not sincere. Often, they pay you in bits and pieces, not minding how you sourced the money to produce the money. But when I was still active as a producer, my marketer, Corporate Pictures, was faithful to me. In fact, he bought me a car, but since he stopped doing business with me, God has not abandoned me. He never cheated me.  There were a lot of challenges that I faced, not only me, but other people in the industry also. Let me tell you some of the challenges; the issue of transportation to locations is a difficult one for me. I have had to transport myself going and coming back, at the end of the day, they will give you peanuts as your pay. Most times, they will tell you they will pay later and it will end there. For each of the movies back then, I was paid N25,000. Imagine a widow with five children surviving on such a meager fee. It got to a point where I wanted to go back to nursing. A lot of people advised me against it. They thought my husband would be forgotten, but I must keep on struggling. The other challenge I faced was when I lost my husband, a long time ago, in 1984 precisely, I thought the world would come to an end.\u00a0 It was difficult for me to cope as a woman, especially with the financial aspect. I had to continue from where my husband stopped and there was no money in theatre then. I had to meet one of my late husband\u2019s friends, who said that I would have to sleep with him before I could get the money. I was shocked because this was someone we all called father and who was a very close ally of my late hubby. Then my marriage was another challenge. I did not enjoy my marriage because my husband died a long time ago and since then, I decided not to re-marry. I have five children and they have all made me proud. God has been my pillar of support. My late mother was also a great helper; she took care of my children whenever I went on location. But I usually made it a point of duty to go to their schools whenever I was around to supervise their education. What I missed most about my mother is that I no longer have a bed partner. Ever since the death of my late husband, we had always slept together and now she is gone. Then whenever I went to locations, she was always there for me. Above all, my mother loved me so much, she had six of us and I was her only female child.  I must confess that theatre has paid off for me because I have a house and a car of my own, and my children are graduates. One of my sons is a very popular writer.

Recording Tambele was an interesting experience. When the inspiration to record came, I reached out to my producer, Olatunde Obajeun, who was in France at the time and I in the USA. I gave him an idea of the song and he said I should give him about a week. He worked on the beat when he got back to Nigeria, and I recorded my vocals at the Hot box studios, Pittsburgh PA USA. I had a few corrections to make on the beat, so I reached out to him again, and this time, he was in Amsterdam, so we kept going back and forth for a while, and I was preparing for the Picklesburgh festival (the biggest specialty Food Festival in America), at the same time. It was very tight but I was not ready to rush the process. I love taking my time when recording, because I only want to give my best. So, we finally finished recording Tambele and then I had to catch my flight to Paris the day after for the Figas Festival. Thereafter, I had to coordinate with my team to get the master and finalise the entire recording process while in Paris. In summary, Tambele was worked on in four different countries and three continents, USA, France, Amsterdam and Nigeria.  The song came as a succour at a time of personal grief. The month of July was really\u00a0 tough for me. Firstly, I lost my beautiful, beloved goddaughter, Funmilola to sickle cell anaemia. It was painful for me as she was 20-years-old already. I also lost my godmother, Mama K, same month. Then I travelled from the USA to France and Croatia, trying to distract myself from the pains. I finally found some answers in my soon to be released music entitled, \u201cTambele\u201d.\u00a0 This song is for you, and for me. I choose happiness, I\u2019m still broken, but amidst all, I choose to rise above my situation, and I hope you feel the same strength the song has given me. Also, the inspiration for \u2018Tambele\u2019 came to me as result of what the world is going through right now. The post-Covid era brought about so much depression and mental health crisis. I was working on something entirely different, then I found myself singing Tambele bele bela be lamba. I didn\u203at know what I was saying, but I noticed I was smiling and excited while singing the song. So, I picked up my phone and started recording the new sound. Tambele means \u2018happiness is free\u2019. In my personal dictionary, Tambele is aimed at making you smile, dance and forget about your problems. I just want to see people genuinely happy; I want the song to help heal the depressed. The lyrics is a compilation of short funny stories about a small city where the people had their plenty issues that were solved by something as simple as palm wine and the new dance, Tambele.  The fact that the beat of the song was created in three different continents was a major challenge. Time differences was one of the major issues, communicating what I want exactly to my producer that was thousands of miles away was another, then working with my American studio engineers that are not 100 per cent inclined in Afropop. But we made it work perfectly at the end of the day. All their expertise and diversity brought the uniqueness to Tambele.  We are currently working on the storyboard for the visual of Tambele, and we will be filming as soon as everything is finalised.\u00a0 Let me say in a month or so. And yes, I have other songs ready to be released, then the album follows. I\u2019m excited.  The album is scheduled for the end of the year. I\u2019m super excited to share my body of work with the world. It has been about 20 years of recording. I can\u2019t wait to share the album with the entire world.  My kind of music is unique, I get inspired by personal experiences, sometimes a random smile from a child can make me pick my pen to write and put sounds together. My music is rooted in the African Highlife music, Afrobeat, Afropop, afrojazz, afrosoul, traditional Yoruba music and so on. I call it Afroclassic. It is a blend of so many experiences from my musical journey.  Traveling around the world has been my biggest real life education. It helped me realise that there is no box, the only box is in your heart. The world is yours to conquer. Music from Africa is globally loved, it is very pleasing to my heart whenever I am in some parts of the world. I enjoy nice dinner or wine at nice restaurants, stores, events, radio and TV stations, then African music keeps coming up, and it feels just natural and beautiful, and my\u00a0 heart is filled with joy. Recently, I did two shows in Croatia on an Island in Dubrovnik and I was amazed at the reception of my music, the sing along and dances by my audience thrilled me.  Yes, it has. The world became smaller without walls. Any music can trend and nobody cares where the music is coming from, people just want to be happy, and dance to tunes and I\u203am loving it.  I grew up in a home where music was part of our day to day activities. We wake up to pray every morning, and during morning devotions we have to sing before anything. My dad also had some interesting music collections from Jazz to RnB, Juju, Fuji, Afrobeat, Highlife, e.t.c. And I had my church choir experiences since I was age five. I always had my imaginary one million crowd and my pet bottle as a microphone in front of the mirror as a child, and I will perform for real.  I love my root. I\u2019m an African woman. I love to look good. I love luxury. I love jewelry, I love beads, I love to smell good, I love big and headwrap,\u00a0 I love to make a statement, so I always take my time to give my audience a show, not just music, but a total package, l don\u2019t know how not to dress up.  Singing at the baseball game, and becoming the first African to sing the baseball anthem at a live show at the Citizens Bank Park Stadium in Philadelphia in 2015, singing at the Pan African Women\u2019s conference in South Africa with the legendary Winnie Mandela in attendance in 2005, having my song \u201cKnocking on Heaven\u2019s Door,\u201d played at the World cup in Rio Brazil, singing at the legendary Ms Naomi Barbara King\u2019s 90th birthday celebration and so on. Every stage is special to me.  My foundation EWA Global initiative has touched the lives of so many youths and women across Africa, and we are working to do more to support young girls. We\u2019re getting ready to go to Togo, Ivory coast, Nigeria, and Senegal for some outreach. EWA Global initiative is aimed at supporting youths and women in Africa. Helping the youth stay out of trouble by creating an enabling self-esteem for them to thrive and building their self esteem. We also give some incentives to African women to start a trade and support their families.  I want to travel the entire world.  I love to cook. I\u2019m a shy person and I\u2019m very bad with roads, I use the GPS to drive to the same place for months.

I feel it is necessary and I believe that with the way Nigeria is going, if we have another wrong government there may not be a Nigeria again. I love this country so much. Secondly, when I found out the new voting system released by INEC, I was fired up to let people know that their votes may now actually count. What I meant by that is that come 2023 when you vote, the number of votes will be uploaded for the public to see. There are no longer cases of ballot boxes being stolen and snatched like we used to experience in the past. What that means is that if we can have just one per cent of the 1.2 billion BBNaija votes total to go and vote and have a consensus of who we want, we are going to have the Nigeria we desire. I want my daughter to come home to Nigeria and not be scared of insecurity and some of those troubles that we are going through. That is what I\u2019m doing; I\u2019m fighting for my kids. I always say that being nominated is as good as a win because for me it means you are being recognised for something and it\u2019s a good recognition. For me, it\u2019s something I was excited about and the person that won it deserves it. I know him, he works tirelessly and creates great content for us, so there will be many more nominations and hopefully a win but before that we are expectant and keep working hard.  I have two more productions but the reason I produced Mambas Diamond is to let people know that doing the right thing pays and I shot it with the purpose not just to entertain but to teach young people that anything that is not given to you by God might be taken and even your life might be taken. It was a movie I did to sensitise youths all over the world and it\u2019s coming on streaming platforms very soon. It might be on Amazon.  It is called Sugar Rush 2. This is what is currently on my table, but there are two bigger projects coming out from my production outfit and the aim is to further change the narrative of movie production using state of the art equipments.  At this point, I would say the grace of God. We really don\u2019t control anything. You wake up in the morning without knowing how. For me, I just prioritise and put God\u2019s will before mine and allow that to play out.  My background, I have been in a low place in my life. I didn\u2019t grow up with a silver spoon and I know what it feels like not to have, not to have food. As a young boy, I went hungry because there was no food at home. I tell people that to find your purpose; first you must find what you are passionate about and what they are very angry about.  It has taught me everything. Nobody is prepared for fatherhood when the time comes. A different type of love that I never knew I had came alive and I can\u2019t explain it. It is when you become selfless and think not of yourself but of that selfless need to be there for your child. It has been an amazing experience and it\u2019s just truly God\u2019s gift.  I think it is doing extremely well, I think Nigeria is one of the most creative and one of the most respected industries in the world. Of course, our contents trend on the global market, which means that we are doing something right. We have created jobs for a lot of young people that could have been doing something illegal, having depression or suicidal thoughts. It has been an escape for some of them and I just pray they use it to promote our culture and to have a better nation in general. When I see a film that nobody will learn from. When the movie is promoting something that I don\u2019t stand for, no matter the amount you give me. The money will finish but the movie remains. I have certain standards and morals that I keep and if that is not in the movie, I don\u2019t do it.  It has been amazing. I got into the industry at the age of 8. It\u2019s my 22nd year in the industry. At a point, I took a break, travelled out of the country to focus on my education. Yes, it has been a great journey so far.  I wouldn\u2019t say I was personally mentored by anyone, but their various works inspired me to do more. I remember the first movie I did with Pete Edochie, who is a great, living legend of our time I was overwhelmed with enthusiasm. He inspired me quite a lot along with others on that production set: Clems Ohameze, Hilda Dokubo and others.  It wasn\u2019t planned, as a matter of fact; I have always been hilarious, to the best of my knowledge. We are just a funny family. My dad, siblings, I never for once thought of taking it out of comfort zone outside. Because of my \u2018status\u2019, I thought when I go out there, I need to be cool as an actor. But when I realised the power of being yourself, it changed everything. I started comedy when I was in California. I just tried out a video and people loved it and kept reposting. It got a lot of views. One day, I received a message in my DM (Direct Message) from a woman who requested to speak with me. When she called, she was crying, saying \u2018Thank you so much, you don\u2019t know what you have done for us\u2019. She said her mother had been sick with cancer for over 6 months and she had not seen any reason to smile until she came across my comedy and she had\u00a0 been laughing all through. She said that it got everyone emotional and they thought they should call and thank me. That was when I realised that this is not just what I do for an art but a ministry, especially in Nigeria, where you have a lot of people who are going through so much. The least I can do is to release stress by humour. They say laughter is a good medicine. People call me a comedian but I prefer to be called an actor, because an actor can make you cry, make you laugh, can play around and that is what I consider myself to be.  I like to worship. I put on a worship song or piano instrumental that can play for three hours. I just sit there and take it all in. Also, I like to see movies, go on Netflix, look for the ones that are interesting, get a snack, sit in front of my TV and relax.

This victory is just an indication that one day; your talent will pay off. I have learnt never to give up even though there were moments I felt like what is the essence of coming out as best graduating student in my class? My best is yet to come and the industry had better look out for more promising jobs from me. It is a welcome development and I am not taking this for granted. The award has added a feather to my cap and I believe this will go a long way.  One day at a time, every step is important in renewing the image of the Nigerian people. We have our arts to do this. I feel like art and culture, film or music is a ministry for human emancipation, for telling stories and for changing the narrative. We are doing it one day at a time and we will get better. I just feel that most importantly, it starts with you and I being focused about the things that we do daily.  I have always been passionate about the art. I have always said that it\u2019s not just about talent for me, it\u2019s a ministry. I\u2019m very passionate about the kind of scripts that I take on, the kind of stories that I\u2019m part of. I turn down a lot of scripts but the truth is when you don\u2019t know where you are going to, everywhere will look like the way, but when you know where you are going to, from the beginning of your career, you channel your path and you are very mindful about it. Sometimes, it looks like, \u2018what are you doing\u2019, but if you have a bigger picture in mind, you will definitely get there. Nothing good comes easy.  If I don\u2019t believe in the story, if I don\u2019t like the script itself and don\u2019t believe in what it is preaching, I will turn it down. This is not a shade to any producer or director but I know that day by day, we are getting better and telling better stories.  It\u2019s talent, career, passion but it\u2019s also a profession. You also have to make money out of it. If the money is not good, but I believe in the story, I will take it because sometimes money is not everything.\u00a0 Leaving your name in the good sands of time is more important.  I stand strongly for professionalism, quality, discipline, integrity and consistency because at every particular time; keep working as nobody wants to work with a lazy actor.  It depends on how the nudity is being created. You can create nudity in a very creative way and it will be tastefully done; also what is the essence of that nudity?\u00a0 Again it\u2019s not just like I want to show my body for example, you want to act a rape victim scene, there is no way that it would be played and dress won\u2019t be ripped. Well, it\u2019s really not bad to be naked.  Do not ever forget what you are made of, life would be hard but you have to find inner strength to go on. Everything you need to make it in life is in you and God\u2019s hands; it\u2019s been deposited by God. It\u2019s okay to be you but know one thing that you are destined to be great and you will be great and nothing anybody will do or say that will drag you back and I will just whisper to her that, Omowunmi Dada just know that you are a star and you are going to change the world.  This I always say that whatever you do, always give it your best because sometimes ,it only takes one scene for someone to notice your good job for referral in projects you can never imagine in your life. Your success is in the hands of God and you.  I can\u2019t rule that out of my life anyway because that is also part of the build up for me. You can\u2019t become a star in a day; I enjoy the process as it makes me more professional and diligent as this will further motivate me to always give my best at every point in time.  Well for me, the first time I was on TV was as a presenter in a Nigeria Reality show for kids\u00a0 in 2008 but my first movie was an epic movie, entitled \u2018 Oya\u2019. I have featured in countless movies and soaps\u00a0 but the truth is so many people are yet to know me and that\u2019s why I need to constantly give my best to all I in case anyone stumbles on me and like who is this person but sincerely I can\u2019t pick on one exactly. But for every job I have done, I feel so honoured to do them all.  For me, I am an all round actress; I can do any of the two perfectly.  Either of the two, one thing is sure constant, which is training because whatever thing you have to do as an actor; you can\u2019t run away from training because you can\u2019t just wake up and jump into what you are not trained for. In every profession, there is talent and sure you have to be well-trained before the job can be well done. We have a lot of people who did Theater Arts in school and are now in banking hall doing well. For someone like me, my passion is key. If am at home and \u2018am not working or not on set, I won\u2019t be happy within me.  No. Not even marriage can stop me from acting because I want to be old with all my grey hair acting because this is what I am born to do. It gives 100 per cent fulfillment.  I will say when I acted in the movie, entitled, \u2018Moremi\u2019, where I played the role of a boxer. For me to be able to deliver on the role; I had to go train as boxer for two months. I equally just rounded off on a project with Ebonylife; there also I had to go all the way out to do research on the role and when we had the private screening sometimes ago and I saw a lot people crying, I was so happy about what I did for myself with the role I played.\u00a0 For me as a brand, I don\u2019t run away from challenges and hard work.  The first challenge that I had as an actress was my stature. When I attended auditions back then, people usually told me, \u2018\u2018Oh you are very good and quite talented but unfortunately, you are small in stature.\u2019\u2019 I used to be very skinny and I am still not big now so, my small stature posed a challenge. Even the colour of my skin was another major challenge. Sometimes, people would tell me that I am dark-skinned and they want a light-skinned person for a particular role but I am very happy that right now, filmmakers now look past the complexion of actors and\u00a0the focus is now on talents and what you can bring to the table. It\u2019s now about what you\u2019ve got inside of you, your level of discipline and your craft. Those were some of the things I had to deal with and I surmounted them. Of course, I love challenges and I love playing characters that enable me to be able to task myself. I don\u2019t like to feature in movies with drab characters. The farther I am from a character, the more excited I am to conquer challenges.  There are lots of dream roles but the most important for me at the moment is getting an action role call in a Hollywood movie. I would say comfortable, classy and edgy.

The rapper had trended on social media platform early Friday after a tweet by the Public Relations officer of Lagos State Police command, Benjamin Hundeyin accused him of assaulting and threatening to abduct a Policeman in Lekki area of the state around 3 a:m. The Police alleged that Ice Prince was driving to a destination in the state when the police patrol team in the area stopped him for driving without license plates. It is not uncommon for Nigerian celebrities to drive vehicles around without license plates. R learnt that the policemen had insisted the Aboki crooner should visit the station and after agreeing, he was said to have driven the carin company with a policeman, with the intention to visit the station but allegedly assaulted the officer and threatened to throw him into the river. As the matter continues to dominate discourse on social media, fans asked why the Police PRO didn\u2019t share the location of the river in which Ice Prince had threatened to throw the policeman, fuelling insinuations that the rapper might have been framed. Reactions trailed his arrest on Twitter as fans were divided over the arrest. A section of his fans insisted the police may be up to their usual game of rushing the arraignment process just to drag Ice Prince to court and paint him in bad light. Others cautioned those supporting Ice Prince against the police, pointing out that many Nigerian celebrities always act like they are above the law, especially when they are behind the wheels. However in his tweet, Hundeyin, who broke the news on Twitter said the artiste abducted the policeman and assaulted him but was later arrested and would be arraigned. It was gathered that friends and colleagues of the rapper had been making efforts to reach out to the police in order to resolve the matter amicably but were said to have been rebuffed. A source who spoke with R on Friday said the \u201cPolice authority in Lagos appears to be angry at the attitude of Ice Prince and they have insisted he would be arraigned. No one could tell what the next plan would be, but we are still engaging them with our lawyers who are on ground,\u201d he added.

I was told about my musical enthusiasm as a child; so the discovery has been before I can do anything with the reality. Well, I won\u2019t say the surge is done. But then God helping me, I\u2019ve done a lot of musical numbers to celebrate a lot of people and God has kept on the status and interests of a large crowd due to consistent uploads of great works. The effect of all of these and my current trending release \u201cYou are the most high\u201d contributed largely the popularity. Instagram created the bridge; the connection to meet a large audience.  I discovered early that people love the way I sound and my creativity with music. I just want to express what I think about different spheres of life via this mode. In the early days of creating content, I was inspired by those who did this before me. Someone like EmmaohmyGod and every vocal creative people online helped me a lot. I don\u2019t agree with that notion. My location has no negative effect on my career. Many people who are familiar with Adebisi Emmanuel Adetayo a.k.a Bisimanuel, knew him online while he was doing his music from Akure. I\u2019m a pure example of the location doesn\u2019t make the person. There have been a lot of issues with doing covers of other artistes. Until your cover becomes a crowd-pleasing sensation, everyone is fine. That has not stopped us from doing covers though; we just share the energy across different music styles and opportunities.  I will always say God first; He daily loads me with inspiration to drive the dream. Another thing that drives me is my experience, and of course my country and the world at large Well, I just love singing. Also every opportunity I get to praise God, bless other people, so I just keyed into that.  I charge huge money too; I pray I grow to charge more (smiles). But I don\u2019t charge to go praise God anywhere.  I charge when I play at corporate events, weddings, naming, burials, birthdays and even online The trick and joy is I didn\u2019t know what I was building, and years after we started I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m trying to build anything.  Akure is a peaceful place, where most people don\u2019t care about what you are doing or why. I have peace and freedom to create my contents.  I\u2019m currently doing my PHd in Computer Science, so that would have been my thing. The Ondo State Yearly Praise Party, with the blinding lights and the crowded park.  That will come pretty soon.

The announcement, which was made on Monday, October 17, is in partnership with Unitaid, The Global Innovation Fund and Paramount. The new season of MTV Shuga Naija will promote HIV prevention and self-testing, and COVID-19 including vaccine uptake, while tackling gender-based violence and promoting gender equity. Together with on-the-ground activities, the programme will target young people aged 15 to 24 years. The campaign has also announced the kick-off of the MTV Shuga Naija online auditions for aspiring talents to join the MTV Shuga Naija alumni. Online submissions will close on October 24 and aspiring talent can visit www.casting.ng/mtvshugaauditions to audition. The new MTV Shuga Naija season will experience a revamp from past seasons that fans know and love, from addressing gender issues in the media to investing specifically in growing female-led companies in the Nigerian film industry. The MTV Staying Alive Foundation will launch a talent accelerator programme, which will offer internship and mentorship programmes for emerging female creatives in different areas of production, to accelerate advancement towards \u2018gender-aware\u2019 media, through the production of MTV Shuga Naija and the strengthening of local capacity. The programme will support the pathway for gender-transformative, high-quality content production and give more young females an opportunity to take on senior roles in future seasons of MTV Shuga Naija. Considering this, the fifth season of the TV drama will be produced by 1Pod Pictures, a female-led production company, founded by directors, Isioma Osaje and Temidayo Makanjuola.

The new season will also encourage conversations centered around gender-based violence among young people and how to seek help; as well as raising awareness of the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 and passing it to higher-risk age groups, and the importance of vaccination. Anita Aiyudu, Country Manager, MTV Shuga Naija commented, \u201cSince the first MTV Shuga season was created in 2009, we have worked with a range of local media production companies and tested various gender-based storylines in our content across regions. With this campaign in Nigeria, we have created a strategic approach to promote female-led production companies through our talent accelerator programme, which will guide emerging female creatives to hone their craft and make a name for themselves, while encouraging dialogue on real issues affecting young people. We are excited about the huge potential for the project and really grateful to our partners for making it happen.\u201d Monde Twala, Board Member, MTV Staying Alive Foundation (SAF) and Senior Vice President, Paramount Africa, further stated, \u201cMTV Shuga has birthed a paradigm shift in the entertainment and media industry. Through this series, we have engaged the teeming youths of Africa on the importance of several issues, ranging from reproductive and sexual health to human rights and even the importance of vaccination. Our Talent Accelerator Programme geared towards impacting the female creatives in the industry is a step in the right direction for us, even as we intensify our efforts in encouraging gender diversity in the industry, and we know that with the collaboration of our partners, this project will not only be a success but become one of the long-lasting legacies that will resonate in generations to come.\u201d Speaking on the Global Innovation Funds objective to promote innovations that increase the agency of women and girls, Rachna Nag Chowdhuri, Managing Director for Grants and Impact said, \u201cIt\u2019s great to see MTV Shuga Naija returning for another season. Our work focusing on Innovating for Gender Equality prioritises those approaches which make the biggest impact on gender norms at scale. This series is a great example of that \u2013 it has a fantastic track record of tackling issues most important to young men and women, the evidence that it makes a positive difference to sexual health behaviours, gender-based violence and norms around gender equality, and the platform to reach millions of young women at a crucial stage in their lives. We are also excited that MTV Shuga is not just promoting gender equality through its content, but also within the media industry by cultivating local female-led production companies.\u201d Speaking on supporting the campaign, Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director, Unitaid, a global health organisation that funds promising innovations, such as HIV self-tests and new HIV prevention tools, which have the potential to make sweeping improvements in global health commented: \u201cGender inequality is one of the main socioeconomic factors contributing to inequities in global health responses. Unitaid is proud to support MTV Shuga Naija in its innovative and holistic approach to empower young women with critical health information through their programming while promoting greater career opportunities for women in the entertainment industry.\u201d Adesua Wellington also shared her excitement on the return of a new season saying, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that \u2018Sheila\u2019 is back on the new season of MTV Shuga Naija.

He simply wants to keep making good music and taking care of his family. For him, hitting the global stage with his talent was God\u2019s way of giving another chance at life as he revealed he was once an inmate in a London prison. It was a tough ride for the singer who against all odds rose to prominence and earned his place when it seemed his world had crumbled around him. Despite the success he has recorded in the last few years on the global music scene, one of which earned him the Grammy Award in 2021, the \u2018Common Person\u2019 singer is not bothered about the laurels he has earned, but the music he gives to his fans. Days back, he was dragged into a conversation by some fans on social media platforms who attempted spite him by saying Wizkid remains the biggest artiste in Africa following Kanye West\u2019s endorsement of his famous song, Essence, as the biggest song in the world at the moment. Burna Boy who has been on tour in different cities across Europe would not welcome any comparison between him and anyone as he lashed out at fans who made such attempt, saying he didn\u2019t care about who the biggest artiste in Nigeria is. He also revealed that many people didn\u2019t know that he came into the music industry from prison, saying he never knew he would live this long. \u201cWhen people talk about me now, it always sounds funny to me because they don\u2019t know my story and the journey I had before this moment. \u201cI came into the Music industry straight from Chelmsford HMP. I had no idea I would even live this long,\u201d his tweet read. He also recalled his prison experience while living in the United Kingdom. Unknown to many, the artiste had done time in HM Prison Chelmsford, before starting as a musician. Interestingly, Burna Boy hinted at his prison experience in the song, \u2018Glory\u2019 off his 2022 album, \u2018Love, Damini\u2019. In the song, which features the South African male choral group, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Burna Boy sings about getting into fights and getting injured in prison. The lyrics went: \u201cI remember when they shipped me from the cans To Chelmsford HMP and my celly had it bad.So I had to have his back, niggas started fightin\u2019. Then they cut me on my hand.\u201d At one of his recent shows, the singer performed with a broken leg as he gave his best to thrill fans despite the pain he felt all through his performance. Burna,however, said he will continue to perform with \u201cinjured or even no legs or no arms.\u201d  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/my-journey-from-prison-to-global-stage-burna-boy/"},

In a recent chat with ROTIMI IGE, the surveyor spoke on why young people need to invest in real estate and why he is passionate about reducing housing deficit. How do you discover the business of real estate? Real estate has been one of the oldest securities on earth and it has a lot of potential. I\u2019ve been eager to be in the business since I was a young child but didn\u2019t know how. My mother convinced me about studying land survey after I finished my secondary education and I grew passion for the profession through the help of the late surveyor, Oludiran Owolabi (Jacoban Survey). He had advised and encouraged me about the profession. I keyed into real estate development four years ago, having discovered and seen a lot of opportunities in it. Most people buy land without realising how best to earn cash flow or make the best use of it. I want to encourage people to invest in real estate development because I believe in building wealth through development. My mother and I established WH Consultant Limited to help solve most of these problems. She\u2019s a retired director of town planning in the Oyo State civil service and a fellow of Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP). WH Consultants birthed Riverside estate at Iyana Offa, Ibadan early this year; a fully residential and commercial estate which we have commenced its first construction stage and hope to deliver by the third quarter of 2023.  What challenges do you seek to address? There are opportunities to develop a regional housing strategy and incentivise private -sector housing development. There are three alternative development models and I\u2019m adopting the polycentric regional model which is a multi-modal approach to creating a planned compact urban form. This model would create a sustainable and livable environment. Estate development also create job opportunities and employment (direct and indirect) Another challenge is to sensitise people about real estate investment and development. Most people are always skceptical about investing or purchasing property because of the issues and scam involved and that\u2019s why I always like and advise people to see or get all necessary information, documents and title before payment. Real estate can be easy, accessible and affordable to everyone. We\u2019re working towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 9 which is industry, innovation and infrastructure development and Goal 11 which is creating sustainable cities and communities.  Housing is one of the basic amenities required for humans. What have you been doing to address this deficit in Nigeria and what plans do you have to ensure that housing is affordable? I\u2019m working toward making the basic shelter amenities accessible and affordable to the citizens through offering flexible and mortgages plans for our estate and properties projects and programmes in the state.  What challenges have you faced in this business? It\u2019s not easy but I keep thanking God for being with me with what has been achieved so far since I started this journey. I won\u2019t say it has been a challenge but rather a task. The very first task I faced was getting a genuine and secure land for the establishment of the estate development because it can be very tough not to get scammed but with the right guide and investigation, one can avoid such situation. It\u2019s always good to know about the land before you put your money into it. And that\u2019s what we did and we acquired the necessary paper documents to ensure it was genuine and secure for our esteemed subscribers and investors. Another task was the finance, where I had to convince off-takers and investors about our estate project and key them into our development and tell them how beneficial it can be for them to be a part. There was a time I had to travel down to Lagos from Enugu to convince some of our investors. So far, the journey has been amazing and I\u2019m prepared for more tasks ahead.  How do you relax? I like brain tasking work. I like activities that challenge my sense of creativity and knowledge. I read and watch the news because I believe information is the new wealth. I like travelling and I\u2019m open to team work.

Founded in Switzerland in 1998, the company which specialises in voile is presently leading new\u00a0projects and items specific to the Nigerian market. According to Riem Ali Taha, Suntex AG will be\u00a0looking for opportunities to expand. \u201cThe Nigerian market is important to us because most of our products and designs key into the\u00a0diverse culture and lifestyle of its people, from the North to the South. We are known for our\u00a0high-quality Swiss voile fabrics. We have our own secret which we infuse into creating the voile\u00a0materials. This has grown into an essential part of Nigerian culture, receiving widespread\u00a0attention from the art, design and quality,\u201d she said. She further stated that Suntex AG creates fashionable Swiss textiles for the different traditions\u00a0of Africa, specialising in cotton voile. This, she said, includes textiles such as African voile\u00a0embroideries, prints, jacquards, brocade, guinea brocade, Atiku, Lam\u00e9 as well as turbans. \u201cOver the next few years, we intend to gain experience and more customers in the Nigerian\u00a0fashion industry including the North-Eastern and West African market and African consumers in\u00a0African metropolitan cities,\u201d Taha added. According to her, the Nigerian textile industry is witnessing a reawakening and Suntex AG is here\u00a0to complement the effort already being put in by both the government and key players. That is\u00a0why the company has upgraded its embroidery factory in Switzerland to meet the needs of the\u00a0growing market. It also intends to establish embroidery mills in the country in the near future. Suntex Ag is mindful of the strides that the Nigerian textile industry has made in recent times. \u201cFor an industry which demands are never in short supply, we are here to match the needs of\u00a0Nigerians and ensure that our wide array of products becomes an acquired taste with Nigerians\u201d.

It was reported that Mohbad claimed to have been attacked and assaulted by men suspected to be loyal to Marley when he demanded for a change of manager, a move which was said to have been perceived by Marley as a step taken too far and was allegedly rebuffed. Mohbad who is signed to Marlian Music in a video shared on his social media platforms on Wednesday claimed that he was attacked by the management of the label for demanding a new manager, saying that he was attacked and left with physical injuries when he visited the Marlian House to make his intention known. Many of his fans had reacted angrily and called for Marley\u2019s head as he was said to have been fingered in the fiasco that resulted in rushing their favourite artiste to the hospital in the late hours of Wednesday. But Marley countered Mohbad\u2019s claim in a live video saying the artiste was not mentally stable, as no one in his team attacked him as claimed in his video. He also described the drama as a family affair that would be resolved amicably. \u201cMohbad has a history of getting intoxicated, which affects his emotions and actions. #ImNotPerfect. However, all issues would be resolved amicably within the record label,\u201d he had said in a live video in the aftermath of Mohbad\u2019s allegation. Apparently miffed by Marley\u2019s defence and submission, Mohbad took to his Twitter handle to set the records straight in a manner that suggested his time with Marlian Music may be up. \u201cThe events of the last two days have left indelible scars in my heart. I have always just wanted to create good music and to provide for my family and myself through my music. As an artiste from the street, I thought the Marlian Family would be a good place for me. \u201cHowever, recent events and certain truths have come to light which threaten my peace, health and career. Because of these issues, I informed Naira Marley on the Marlian WhatsApp group chat of my intention to change my manager. \u201cThis didn\u2019t go down well with my current Manager, Tunde (his brother). There were instant angry outbursts and protests from him in the chat. I went to Naira Marley\u2019s house with my producer and my friend on the 4th of October, 2022, to have this conversation and reach a peaceful resolution. \u201cWe were in the studio, and some of the guys who work with Naira- Sid, Shuddy, Seyi and others- were present, as well as Naira and Tunde. I noticed Tunde was quite agitated as we started the discussion. In the middle of the conversation, Tunde became violent and attacked me. \u201cThe guys I was with were also attacked, humiliated and stripped naked by Sid, Shuddy and Seyi and some of the other boys. We were barely able to escape. 3 of us had to be checked into the hospital to get medical care for the injuries sustained during the assault. \u201cNaira Marley was fully present throughout this event, and in fact, coordinated some of the attacks as he instructed the boys to beat us up. Some of this was captured on video. It is therefore disrespectful for Naira Marley to insinuate that I started the attack because I was intoxicated as he is fully aware of the facts and circumstances surrounding this violent attack. \u201cIt is not the first time Naira has lied to push his own narrative, but it will hopefully be the last. I trust that soon, justice will be served,\u201d he said.  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/marlian-music-house-in-turmoil/"},

And by making it big, it means having popular songs, performing at sold-out shows, winning awards, collaborating with peers, and earning hefty royalties. But for some, these goals are not enough. They dream of more. They are not just satisfied with making great music, they want to shape the entertainment industry\u2019s culture. Kaptain Kush is one of this rare breed of music creatives. Born in Mainland Lagos in the early 2000s, Lawrence Godwin Kingsley is an Afropop and dancehall artiste. Inspired by the effect that music had on members of his community, Kaptain Kush decided to become a musician. A self-taught artiste, he is a singer, songwriter, and record producer. Kaptain Kush\u2019s musical journey has seen him release a couple of hit Afropop songs that did great numbers in the local music industry. For the Somolu-born music artiste, becoming a superstar was the dream. \u201cLike most artistes, I wanted to blow as a mainstream musician. I desired that my music should be played across the country and be exported to other nations,\u201d he says. And he did tow that line. He honed his craft through several hours of studio sessions, making music that will touch the hearts of lovers of Afrobeats. Understanding that succeeding in the industry required marketing, he invested in promotion, making it easy for his target audience to find his music. Kaptain Kush had already started performing at shows in major cities in Nigeria when he had a paradigm shift. He decided he didn\u2019t want to make music alone and wanted to diversify his interest.

In the past two years as CEO, Kaptain Kush has grown The City Celeb into one of the culture-shaping entertainment brands in the country.

Positive relationships with dogs and other pets aid in the development of trusting relationships with others. A good relationship with a pet also helps in developing non-verbal communication, compassion, and empathy. Cuddling a pet reduces stress, loneliness and anxiety. What\u2019s more? A child\u2019s relationship with their dog could provide a much-needed link with nature when they take the dog for a walk or gets down on the floor and plays with it.\u00a0 Spending time like this offers the incredible potential to slow down the hectic pace of modern life. When a child plays with a dog or a cat, the animals usually lick him. Although most children are gentle and appropriate with dogs, some are not and end up bitten. But in a rabies-infected dog or cat, a lick or a bite can transfer the rabies virus that lives in animals\u2019 mouths to the child. Rabies is caused by a virus that is present in an infected animal and spread to humans through bites or scratches. When the rabies virus enters the body, it can move along the nerve pathways to the brain. It causes serious symptoms beginning with pain, tingling, and numbness at the site of the bite or scratch and progresses rapidly. According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), more than 95 per cent of rabies cases in humans are from dog bites and 40 per cent of rabies victims are children younger than 15. Some victims, especially children, don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve been exposed until it\u2019s too late. The awareness and attitude of people under 15 to dog rabies are poor. A cross-sectional survey on awareness and attitude of 1,388 pupils under 15 years towards rabies across Kwara State found only 21.7 per cent of them were aware of rabies. It was in the 2022 edition of PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. There are about two dogs per household and approximately 5% of the pupils have been previously bitten by a dog. One-third of the dog-bite victims were managed and treated at home and only 12% were treated in a health facility. Unfortunately, \u201cAs long as there are reservoir hosts for the virus, it will continue to be transmitted to humans and then we will still be having cases of rabies. And the unfortunate thing is that most reservoirs of rabies virus are called friends of humans,\u201d said Professor Daniel Oluwayelu, a virologist and the past head of the Department of Veterinary Microbiology at the University of Ibadan. According to him, rabies has become one of those diseases that are classified as bedroom zoonosis; especially in the advanced world where people even sleep on the same bed, kiss, and maintain very close relationships with their pets. He added, \u201crabies virus can be transmitted through saliva; they can easily have saliva on their face when kissing their dogs and so get infected. Dogs are kept as guard animals because of insecurity in the country. Likewise, many hunters still maintain their hunting dogs.\u201d Professor Oluwayelu stated that getting dogs and other pets vaccinated against rabies is important because rabies kills very fast, faster than all those diseases. \u201cOnce it enters, through a bite on the leg or the arm, rabies has an affinity for the nervous system.\u00a0 It goes straight into the nervous system and ascends from the peripheral to the central nervous system. This takes a matter of days, so rabies kills faster than HIV/AIDS or TB which takes even months before you can start experiencing its signs and symptoms. So, it is not something we should underestimate at all,\u201d he added. He however said individuals, including children, must be responsible for the health of their dogs, cats and other pets. \u201cRabies is still around, so vaccination of dogs, cats, and other pets against rabies must be prioritized. Puppies are supposed to be vaccinated against rabies at three months and then followed up with annual booster doses. \u201cThere is something that is called responsible dog ownership. In developed countries, you are not allowed to keep dogs except if you have been proven to be responsible. And vaccination of those animals is very crucial. A vaccinated dog is given a certificate. In some climes, a vaccinated dog is also given a special collar that it wears on the neck. And animals without such collars are taken off the street.\u201d On the contrary, educating children on how to approach an animal correctly, including safety precautions is vital to prevent being bitten. This includes asking for permission from the owner before engaging a pet and touching the pet gently. Not approaching an animal they don\u2019t know, picking up a stray animal or allowing a dog to lick one\u2019s face, cuts or scratches is also essential. WHO recommends that if bitten by a dog wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water, detergent, povidone iodine or other substances that kill the rabies virus and then seek appropriate medical care as well as an anti-rabies vaccine. Traditional concoctions and spiritual interventions are not the recommended first-line actions after dog-bite incidents, either. The act of killing the dog that bit is highly discouraged and usually results in the under-reporting of rabies. Guardians of dog-bite victims need to quarantine the dogs or call the local veterinary officer who should monitor the dog for 10 to 14 days for a confirmatory diagnosis of rabies.

{"headline": "How workers can improve their eye health in 2020", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/eyesight.jpg", "author": "", "posted_date": "Feb 20, 2020", "description": "At the turn of a new decade and the rise of smart devices ever increasing amongst businesses, how can companies ensure they have the correct provisions in place to maximise eye health amongst staff? It\u2019s no secret that the physical demands we put on our eyes is only increasing over time \u2013 we are spending more and more time in front of screens in work than ever before and it\u2019s crucial that employers recognise this and put provisions in place to account for this added strain. While businesses already have a responsibility to provide reasonable care to those workers that spend significant times in front of screens there is still a long way to go to putting eye health at the top of the employee well-being offering. Optometrists are still witnessing an increasing number of tech-related eye strains in patients, demonstrating the threat devices pose to our long term eye. Companies should encourage staff to put their eye health first in 2020 and here are five ways to do this:  Ensure your team is getting away from their desk at lunch time and ideally for short periods throughout the working day. Going outside and getting some fresh air would be ideal. Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is caused by extended periods of time in front of a screen without a break. Screen glare can cause eye dryness, strain and tiredness which is not something you want when it comes to productivity. While it\u2019s obvious, encouraging your team to take a break throughout the day is key and this should be reflected from the management team upwards \u2013 staff may feel reluctant to take a break if they don\u2019t see their boss doing the same. A quick way to do this is the 20-20-20 technique. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break from your screen to look at something 20 feet away. This vital break will give your eyes a chance to rest and is an effective way to reduce eye strain.  A quality computer monitor is crucial and will be the best investment for any new or existing members of staff. Employees that are spending 7-8 hours a day in front of it deserve a screen that is bright and high quality so ensure you do regular checks and testing to make sure they are up to scratch. Working with a dull screen or glare forces eyes to strain more, which in the long run could severely affect vision. Anti-glare screens are an easy and cost-effective way to support staff with this, reducing the everyday strain on their eyes. However it is important\u00a0 to ensure that sufficient lighting is present around desks for equal brightness since shadows and light glare can cause eye fatigue. Furthermore, ensure computer screens are positioned at least 25 inches from the user.  It may sound trivial but companies must do the basics well. As well as creating a more pleasant place to work, a clean environment with minimal dust is important and will cause less eye irritation to staff. This is particularly crucial to any workers that might have seasonal allergies.  Putting provisions in place to support those wanting to quit smoking can be one of the most effective ways to get staff to give up for good. It doesn\u2019t need to be as extreme as the recent business offering additional holiday as a potential perk but any actions to show you care about their lifestyles can do a world of good. It could be organising a charity fundraiser or other group initiative to let employees know they are not alone when it comes to quitting and can be an easy way to get people to commit to the idea knowing that others are \u2018in the same boat\u2019. Smoking exposes your eyes to high levels of oxidative stress and has been linked to the risk of cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes and dry eye syndrome. Quitting smoking at any stage of life can be beneficial, reducing the risk of developing eye threatening conditions. Regular eye checks are a must for those in front of screens Regular eye examinations are crucial to spotting sight loss or damage before it worsens. Optometrists can help detect conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration which can lead to sight loss, so encouraging your staff to visit an optician every two years is an important step in maintaining good eye health.

{"headline": "Fibroid is not responsible for infertility in all cases \u2014Ajayi", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Fibriod-photo.jpg", "author": "Sade Oguntola", "posted_date": "Oct 8, 2022", "description": "MANY people with fibroids wonder if getting fibroids treated or removed will improve their fertility. Although fibroids and surgical removal may seem scary, they are a common issue that many women live with. Research shows that between 20% and 80% of women will develop fibroids by the age of 50, showing just how many women may live normal lives with undiagnosed fibroids or experience any symptoms of fibroids. Do fibroids cause infertility and should they be removed to increase fertility?\u00a0 Dr Abayomi Ajayi, the MD Fibroid Care Centre at Nordica, Lagos, says, it is a common misconception that fibroids cause infertility, but the truth is that their presence only signifies potential roadblocks to fertility. Ajayi, a fertility expert declared: \u201cFibroid does not cause infertility, but it can interfere with fertility. We know that about 20 to 25 per cent of women with infertility have a fibroid. But it is only 1 to 2 per cent of these women have infertility due to fibroid. These few women have infertility because the fibroid is blocking the fallopian tubes or stopping the fertilized egg from implanting in the womb.\u201d The size, location, and number of fibroids is key to whether they may affect a woman\u2019s ability to conceive and give birth without issue. The location of fibroids can prevent the sperm and egg from joining together for conception. The shape of the cervix (mouth of the womb) may change allowing less sperm to enter the womb. Although many people associate fibroids with infertility, he stated that some women thought to have infertility could have other underlying factors contributing to infertility besides fibroids. A fertility specialist can help assess if fibroids might be hampering conception. \u201cMost women with fibroids will not be infertile. If you have fibroids, you and your partner should be thoroughly evaluated to find other problems with fertility before fibroids are treated,\u201d he added. A lot of women have fibroids and they keep it to themselves because they don\u2019t want to surgically remove them even though a majority of these women also have infertility. So they need to have a good assessment of their fertility before burdening the fibroid. Howbeit, he declared that because many Nigerians think that fibroid is the cause of their infertility, they want to treat fibroid without giving any consideration to infertility. But in some of the instances, the male factor is the cause of infertility and not the fibroid in these couples. People with fibroids may be affected by other factors that contribute to infertility. Some other common causes of infertility include damaged fallopian tubes, endometriosis, failure to ovulate, menstrual cycle problems, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and sexually transmitted infections like Chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Dr Ajayi, however, said that even if the fibroids need to be removed because it is thought to be the reason for infertility, care must be taken to ensure that doing this would not deform the womb. More importantly, he said where many fibroids are found, the number to remove should be decided based on whether the woman wants to have all the fibroids removed to treat her symptoms or to remove only those that can compromise her chances of getting pregnant. \u201cFor us involved in assisted reproductive technology (ART), we come across women that the only reason they cannot get pregnant again even through In-vitro fertilization (IVF) is that the doctor has gone to remove like 40 to 50 fibroids and have deformed their womb,\u201d he added. Can women with fibroids can get pregnant naturally? Many people with fibroids wonder if getting fibroids treated or removed will improve their fertility.\u00a0 Professor Chris Aimakwu, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said where the fibroid is affecting conception, when it is removed it improves their chances of conception. According to him, \u201cwe know the kind of fibroid that can compromise fertility, but our patients\u2019 satisfaction is key. When you do surgery for a patient with fibroids, especially when the woman has a huge stomach about the size of a 36-week-sized womb and can hardly move around, sometimes, it is cosmetics that are most satisfactory to the patient. \u201cSometimes you can do less invasive surgery to remove the fibroids so that the woman can conceive. Of course, she can always decide later on to come back to have the leftover fibroids cleared so that she is free of those symptoms. So most times, you have to strike a balance between what the patient wants and what she is going through.\u201d Heavy bleeding, painful periods, a feeling of fullness in the lower stomach, and frequent urination are all symptoms of fibroids. But the only way to be certain of having fibroids is to see the doctor who may be able to feel a lump or mass in the womb and/or may order an ultrasound to confirm fibroids. Whether fibroids cause infertility is the subject of considerable speculation and the impression that fibroids contribute to infertility has arisen from several case series, mostly without controls, where a varying proportion of previously infertile women conceived after their fibroids had been removed.

{"headline": "Why measles booster vaccine dose is important for your kid", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/p4.jpg", "author": "Sade Oguntola", "posted_date": "Oct 15, 2022", "description": "VACCINATORS are over the place with the measles vaccine, oral polio and other vaccines for children. Across the country, children are asked to take vitamin A supplements and other supplements to boost body immunity against illnesses. Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease caused by the measles virus and it is a disease of public health importance that usually affects children younger than the age of five years. The measles virus is spread through coughing and sneezing from close personal contact or direct contact with infected persons. It typically starts like a bad cold with symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis (pink eye). A rash then starts to develop on the head and spreads down to the rest of the body. Many children also get ear infections. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have warned of a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of conditions for measles outbreaks, as measles cases increased by 79 per cent in the first two months of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. In a report, the UN agencies stated that an increase in measles cases in January and February 2022 is a worrying sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases and could trigger larger outbreaks, particularly of measles affecting millions of children this year. \u201cEnsuring that children take doses of the measles vaccine after a previous dose is to boost their immunity against the viral infection. Even if the child has had measles before, the child should still take the dose to further enhance the body\u2019s ability against the infection, even when exposed,\u201d said Dr Adeyemi Adewole, the Programme Manager of Oyo State Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Center. He spoke at a media parley in Ibadan on the commencement of the integrated measles campaign in Oyo State starting on Thursday. It is to avail at least 1.234 million children aged 5 to 59 months for vaccine against measles and other vaccine-preventable childhood diseases at fixed and temporary fixed posts to reduce mortality and morbidity in children across the state. Apart from its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea, including months after the measles infection itself among those who survive. The measles vaccine is frequently given as part of a combined vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella \u2013 known as MMR. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children can become infected in cr\u00e8ches and schools, which is why it is important to protect our children from the virus because if it is not prevented or promptly treated, measles could lead to blindness, pneumonia, and inflammation of the brain which require hospitalisation and on rare occasions can lead to long term disability or death. Moreover, he stated that ensuring that children get vaccinated will also help to prevent the complications associated with measles such as pneumonia and encephalitis, an infection of the brain. Also, they seem more likely to have a milder illness. \u201cMothers need to ensure their children receive all recommended vaccine doses to enjoy the full benefits of vaccination. By age nine months, most children would have taken doses of different vaccines, so we don\u2019t expect any adverse reaction when a child is given a booster dose of measles or in addition to other vaccines like that for polio,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, delaying measles vaccination for whatever reason is also dangerous for children. Researchers in a study, which emphasised the importance of following the timing of immunisation of children, said delaying certain routine immunisations past the first 15 months of life could boost the risk of fever-related seizures. They studied vaccination records of over 323,000 U.S. children from 2004 to 2008 to know if babies whose vaccinations were delayed were more likely to develop fever-related seizures. It found that when vaccination is postponed, the risk of fever-related seizures rises twofold. But the risk is still really low. The study was published online on May 19 in Pediatrics. Meanwhile, according to Dr Babatunde Ogunbosi, a consultant paediatrician at University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, delaying measles vaccination or opting out of booster doses in measles endemic areas is not advisable except there are contraindications to doing so. It is well evident that the consequences of not giving vaccines are far more than the adverse events. So Vaccinations should be performed regardless of age; medically attended febrile seizures following immunization with measles-containing vaccines are rarely encountered.

{"headline": "What push-ups can tell about your heart", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/push-ups.jpg", "author": "", "posted_date": "Feb 21, 2019", "description": "Can you do 40 push ups? No, not over the course of a month, but in a row? If not, can you do at least ten? The answers to these questions may help you determine your risk of heart problems over the next decade, according to a study recently published in JAMA Network Open The study did focus on 1104 male firefighters who were on average 39.6 years old with a standard deviation in age of 9.2 years. Therefore, before you try to get your babies to do push ups, keep in mind that any conclusions from this study came from a fairly specific group of people. Most babies are not firefighters and are terrible at doing push-ups. Although the thought of babies trying to do push-ups with their little arms could be adorable. Also, keep in mind that this was a retrospective cohort study, which basically means looking at what has happened in the past and trying to determine if there were any associations and correlations based on the available data. As a result, any analyses are limited by what data has already been collected and may overlook many different factors. For the study, a team from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the University of Bologna, Public Safety Medical in Indianapolis, Indiana and Indiana University analysed data on firefighters who had visited an outpatient clinic in Indiana that served 10 different fire departments from February 2, 2000, to November 12, 2007. Although 1562 male firefighters had undergone physical exams during this time period, only 1104 had undergone a push-up test. The push-up test involved starting a metronome at a rate of 80 beats per minute and then having the firefighter try to do push-ups at this rate. The firefighter would continue until he reached 80, missed three or more beats of the metronome, or could not go any further. Hence, one hour latte breaks between push-ups wouldn\u2019t have worked. The firefighters also had completed exercise tolerance tests. This involved seeing how long they could walk or run on a treadmill while measuring their heart rates and rhythms and oxygen consumption. Exercise tolerance tests are the more standard way of testing a person\u2019s risk for having cardiovascular problems. But, of course, purchasing and maintaining a treadmill and doing the testing is a lot more involved and expensive than asking someone to drop and give you 80 or 60 or 40 or 20 or one or one-third of a push-up. For each of the 1104 firefighters, the research team had data on whether the firefighter was eventually diagnosed with coronary artery disease or had a major cardiovascular disease event, such as heart failure or sudden cardiac death, in the years after the push-up test up till December 31, 2010. The researchers then tried to determine if there was an association between how the firefighters did on the push-up test and these cardiovascular outcomes. The push-up study focused on a very specific population that did not include women. Call the results more than a push for the push-up test. Those who did more than 40 push-ups were 96% less likely to have had a cardiovascular problem in the subsequent years compared to those who could do no more than 10 push-ups. For all of the other groups, the research team found a rough association between being able to more push-ups and a reduced likelihood of having a cardiovascular problem. For example, compared to those who did 10 or fewer push-ups, those who did between 11 and 20 push-ups were 64 per cent less likely, those who did between 21 and 30 were 84 per cent less likely, and those who did between 31 and 40 were 75 per cent less likely to have eventually developed cardiovascular problems. The researchers found that these associations seemed to roughly follow the risk associations seen with exercise tolerance testing. This prompted the researchers to wonder if a push-up test could be \u201ca simple, no-cost measure, [which] may provide a surrogate estimate of functional status among middle-aged men.\u201d In other words, when a treadmill and exercise tolerance testing is not available, can you just see how many push-ups a person can do as a quick and dirty way (really dirty if the floor is very dirty) to determine a person\u2019s cardiovascular health status and risk for future bad events? Potentially. Having a quick-and-dirty test could be helpful, especially when there is no ready access to an exercise testing laboratory. Just make sure the clinic floor is cleaned regularly and often. However, there are caveats. The study did focus on a very, very, very specific group: male firefighters in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s and from Indiana who went to a particular clinic. That\u2019s pretty darn specific. The findings may not apply if your are different from this population, such as if you are a male firefighter in your 40\u2019s and from Nebraska. The same thresholds may be very different for different people. After all, not everyone is created equal when it comes to doing push-ups. As the late comedian Mitch Hedberg once said, \u201cDogs are forever in the push up position.\u201d So if you are a dachshund, don\u2019t get too overconfident. You may just be built to do push-ups. If you are human, results of the push up test could still be misleading if the top part of your body looks like Mr. Incredible on steroids while the bottom part of you looks like toothpicks. Being able to do lots of push-ups but barely being able to run to the bathroom would not bode well for your cardiovascular health. Conversely, just because relatively weaker arms and shoulders prevent you from doing too many push ups, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you are in bad cardiovascular shape. What this study suggests is that push-up capacity could be one (just one) possible measure that must take into account multiple other measures. A single measure will never be able to fully assess your cardiovascular risk, unless it is perhaps \u201cdid you just have a heart attack\u201d or \u201cdid that man from Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom just remove your heart from your chest?\u201d But even after a heart attack, different people may have different risks of future cardiovascular problems. Having your heart removed from your just chest is a different story.

Periods can last between 3 and 7 days and usually occur every 28 days, though menstrual cycle lengths can vary. Although this biological process affects about half of the world\u2019s population, many myths and misconceptions about it persist. Cultures around the world still vilify menstruation, and consider period blood \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cimpure,\u201d and menstruation itself as a taboo topic. For instance, although this practice is now mostly illegal, some communities \u2014 as a series of recent tragedies in Nepal suggest \u2014 still have the so-called menstruation huts, in which women on their period spend the days in which they bleed in complete isolation. Though this is an extreme example, there are many smaller myths and misconceptions related to menstruation that remain in circulation across the globe. Read this Spotlight feature to find out what some of the most popular misconceptions are, and why they are untrue. Some of the most widespread myths regarding menstruation gravitate around sex while on your period, with the top contender likely being that you cannot get pregnant while menstruating. However, this idea is entirely false. While it is true that, in many individuals, menstruation is the period when they are least fertile, it really depends on the length of their monthly cycles. Peak fertility occurs during the ovulation stage \u2014 which usually kicks in approximately 12 to 16 days before the start of the next period \u2014 when the ovaries produce and release fresh ovules (eggs). And while most menstrual cycles last about 28 days, some cycles can be as short as 21 days, which also impacts when ovulation takes place. Moreover, sperm can live inside the genital tract for up to 5 days or, according to some sources, even 7 days. Thus, having unprotected vaginal sex during your period could mean that the sperm gets to linger for just long enough to coincide with ovulation and fertilize an egg, resulting in pregnancy. Moreover, if you have sex during menstruation without using a condom, the risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) \u2014 including HIV \u2014 or a yeast infection increases, due to the hormonal changes that occur at this time. Vaginal-penile sex during a period can also, in some cases, cause inflammation of the penis head \u2014 a type of infection called \u201cbalanitis.\u201d Still, as long as you take all necessary precautions to avoid an unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of STIs, there is no reason not enjoy sex while on your period \u2014 to the contrary, in fact, as sex can help relieve cramps and improve your mood. Another widespread misconception is that it is unsafe to use birth control pills to enable you to skip your period for a prolonged period. However, recent guidelines from the National Women\u2019s Health Network indicate that it is just fine to suppress menstruation through birth control pills, and most gynecologists agree that this approach is typically safe. Some people even argue that, outside of their role in reproduction, periods are unnecessary, and can be more trouble than they are worth. For instance, James Segars, from the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, told The Atlantic that, \u201cHaving a monthly period is reassuring, but it is certainly not necessary.\u201d \u201cAnd with these long-term, reversible contraceptives, the failure rate is really, really low so women can benefit a lot from them.\u201d For many individuals, menstruation symptoms can be severe and interfere with their normal functioning and quality of life. They may experience heavy bleeding, disabling pain, and other unpleasant symptoms, such as migraines and nausea. Those with dysmenorrhea (painful periods) or certain conditions that cause troublesome symptoms, such as endometriosis, may decide, in agreement with their doctors, that skipping several periods, or skipping menstruation continuously, is the best option for their health and productivity. Courtesy: medicalhealthnewstoday.com Some think that having a bath or even taking a shower during your period is unsafe. This is either because hot water stimulates bleeding, or because the water stops you from bleeding, which can have ill effects. While hot water can help stimulate blood flow, this can actually help relieve menstrual cramps and ease muscular tension. Bleeding does not stop following full immersion in water. However, the pressure from the water may temporarily prevent the blood from flowing out of the vagina. There is no reason not to have a bath or shower during your period. Most likely, relaxing in a bubble bath and feeling cleaner as a result of it will improve your mood and help you cope with menstruation symptoms a little better. Furthermore, it is better and healthier to use water and mild, unfragranced soap to clean the vulva than wipes or other products. This is because many intimate care products can disrupt the delicate bacterial balance in the genital area, making it easier for infections to take hold. A study that Medical News Today reported on last year found a \u201cstrong correlation\u201d between the use of intimate care products, such as gel sanitizers and vaginal cleansers, and a heightened risk of infection. Plus, having a hot bath could bring a host of other health benefits. One study covered on MNT last year suggested that baths may reduce inflammation and improve blood sugar. women sitting together on a sofa Is period synchrony a real phenomenon? One pervasive question surrounding periods is whether can they actually sync. For example, if two or more women spend enough time together, perhaps as roommates, will they have periods at the same time? One person, speaking to MNT, said that she was even taught about period synchrony in school, and was still wondering whether the notion was accurate. She told us: \u201cI heard about period syncing a long time ago when I studied in an all-girls\u2019 school. Then, when I started living with [my two female roommates], I noticed we often had periods around the same time. [Another friend] says that this is due to an alpha-female releasing hormones that affect the period cycles of other women around her.\u201d So is any of this true? After all, many of us are likely to have experienced \u201cperiod syncing\u201d at some point, in a school, work, or home-sharing environment. The notion of \u201cperiod synchrony\u201d first appeared as a scientific idea in a 1971 Nature article. This article argued that women who lived in close quarters \u2014 roommates in a college dorm \u2014 or who were close friends, experienced increased menstruation synchrony. The study\u2019s authors believed that this probably happened because the women who lived so closely together \u201cexchanged\u201d pheromones over time, which eventually led to this phenomenon. However, later studies cast doubts on the methodology researchers used for the 1971 research. The later studies highlighted numerous shortcomings and modifying factors that the original researchers had not accounted for. They also noted a \u201clack of empirical evidence for synchrony in the foregoing studies of both Western and non-Western populations.\u201d Moreover, studies that followed were never able to replicate the findings of the initial research. convincingly. Research published more recently did not find that college roommates experienced menstrual synchrony. Investigators have since become more inclined to believe that the notion is nothing but an enduring myth, with any synchrony being purely coincidental. Alexandra Alvergne, who is an associate professor in biocultural anthropology at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, told the BBC that, \u201cAs humans, we always like exciting stories. We want to explain what we observe by something that is meaningful. And the idea that what we observe is due to chance or randomness is just not as interesting.\u201d Finally, some of the most persistent misconceptions refer to the use of tampons to absorb period blood. Because a person has to insert a tampon in the vagina, some people may worry that this may cause some damage. creative image of tampons Inserting a tampon in the vagina will not break the hymen. One primary worry is that inserting a tampon can break the hymen, which, as popular misconception has it, is a \u201cmark of virginity.\u201d In reality, the hymen is a stretchy membrane that lines the opening of the vagina and does not ordinarily cover the vaginal opening. If this were the case, the hymen would block menstrual blood and other types of discharge from leaving the body. This would be dangerous, requiring surgical intervention to correct. Because the hymen is stretchy, inserting an object as small as a tampon will not cause any tears. And since, during menstruation, the blood lubricates the vagina, inserting a tampon should not be uncomfortable, if done correctly. If still uncomfortable, try using a lubricant to help slide the tampon in. A person should always change tampons regularly, as recommended, about every 4-8 hours. It is essential that a person does this otherwise the accumulated blood, tissue, and bacteria could cause toxic shock syndrome. A second myth that many first-time tampon users have encountered is that a tampon could get lost inside the vagina. This is just not true because there is nowhere for the tampon to go. The cervix is at the top of the vagina, and its opening is much too small for a tampon to penetrate. Moreover, vaginas are only about 3.77 inches (9.6 centimeters) deep, on average, and tampons come with strings that aid removal. So, if the tampon does happen to ride up somewhat, you can always easily search for the string and pull the tampon out carefully. Should you ever encounter a piece of information that you are unsure about, or which you find alarming, speak to a nurse or a doctor, who will be able to fact check it for you. Myths and misconceptions have no place in healthcare.

It has been associated with degenerative diseases such as cancer, type2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension and some psychological issues like bias and discrimination The World Health Organization says that obesity is classified as a chronic and severe disease in developed and developing countries, affecting both adults and children. The amount of fat in the body is measured by the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is the ratio of one body weight and square of the height. The higher the BMI, the greater the risk of developing additional health problems. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered healthy, 25 to 29 is overweight while a BMI of 29.1 and above is obese. Obesity can be a result of genetics, physical inactivity, overeating, taking high-calorie diets, diseases such as hypothyroidism, psychological factors as well as certain medications. Recent research data suggest that the global incidence of obesity has increased Aworogun). more than 75% since 1980, while in the last 20 years it has tripled in developing countries, particularly in low-income countries. More than 1.1 billion adults are overweight, of which 312 million are obese. In Nigeria, the prevalence of overweight individuals range from 20.3% to 35.1%, while the prevalence of obesity range from 8.1% to 22.2%. Certain medications such as orlistat, phentermine, lorcaserin and topramate are used to treat obesity. These drugs have been presented with severe adverse effects such as abdominal pain, flatulence, allergic reactions, dizziness, fatigue, constipation and headache. Medicinal herbs and their bioactive components have been used traditionally to treat myriads of sicknesses and diseases. Researchers have documented 35 commonly used herbs in the management of obesity in southwestern Nigeria. The survey involved 200 respondents between the ages of 18 and 60 years. It comprised males and females from all walks of life. Information on plants used in the management of obesity, their modes of preparation and administration were gotten via oral interviews. It was conducted in six cities of southwestern Nigeria, namely Abeokuta, Ibadan, La gos, Akure, Ado-Ekiti and Ilesha between Au gust and October 2018. The plants identified were collected from the wild by herb sellers and were purchased from them for proper identification. It was in the 2020 Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry. Thirty-five plant species identified for the management of obesity in southwestern Nigeria were used singly while others were in combination with other herbs. It includes Croton penduliflorus (Aworosho), Chryso phyllumalbidum (Baka), Curculigopilosa ( Epakun), Anthocleistadjalonensis (Sapa), Irvingiagabonensis (Oro), Dracaena surcu losa (Olugborogun) and Petiveriaalliacea ( Others are Kigelia Africana (Amuyan), Aloe barteri (Eti-erin), Bitter leaf, Lime, pineapple, Maesobotryabarteri (Olohun) Capsicum an num (Ata), Zingiberofficinales (Ata ile), Rau wolfiavomitaria (Asofeyeye), Heliotropium indicum (Igbeloriakuko), Jatrophacurcas ( Botujefunfun), Colocynthiscitrullus (Baara), Kigeliaafricana (Pandoro), oranges, tobacco leaf, lemon, cloves.

The most used plant part is the fruit which accounted for 34% of the recipes followed by bark (22%), and then leaf (17%), while decoction (55.4%) is the most preferred mode of preparation of the herbs. Some of the plants such as lime, ginger, garlic, lemon, walnut, Curculigopilosa and cucumber can be used singly for weight loss as well as in combination with other herbs.

He moved to Lagos after completing his youth service for better opportunities, while his parents remained in Edo state. Although two of his siblings also reside in Lagos, they are always preoccupied with work, so the three siblings rarely see one other. Chima became an established freelancer within two years of moving to Lagos, rising to the top of his clients\u2019 recommendation lists due to his beautiful designs. He enjoyed designing and experimenting with colors, which was why he was always eager to take on new jobs and clients, However, in his third year in Lagos, he began to struggle with inspiration and he was continually feeling tired, sleeping poorly and struggling to concentrate on tasks. He stopped taking on new clients and struggled to complete the tasks he already had. He became severely depressed but everyone around him \u2013 his friends figured that he was just probably exhausted from work stress as he had been driving himself really hard. On a fateful day, he ended his life via suicide and left behind a note of apology for his family. Everyone was shocked to learn that he had ended his life via suicide. Everyone thought Chima was a happy-go-lucky and boisterous guy who was succeeding in his career and other areas of his life. He was handsome and earning good money. How could he just throw all that away? His parents were especially devastated while his older siblings in Lagos were wracked by guilt that they had not seen him in a while, though they still spoke with him in the preceding week.  The sober facts of avoidable and painful loss of precious human lives through suicide as we see with Chima here, remains a tragic reality. A million suicide deaths occur globally every year, with about 20 million attempted suicides occurring in the same time frame. This implies that every 40 seconds, a human life is lost through suicide, somewhere on this planet. Yet we know that suicide is always preventable. Thus, September 10 every year has been set aside to create awareness about Suicide Prevention. Every suicide death has been estimated to affect, on the average, at least 138 people across various spheres of interaction \u2013 such as at school/work, friends, family members, neighbours, and so on. With nearly a million suicides every year, that implies that about 138 million people are closely affected by suicide deaths every year. It should be immediately clear, that suicide prevention justifiably, is now a public health priority.  This year\u2019s theme for world suicide prevention is \u201ccreating hope through action\u201d. All of us can do something and be there for someone. i). Individuals: At the individual level, if you suspect the individual is at risk, do not dismiss your suspicion. Do not leave them alone but ensure someone is with them at all times. Let them know you are concerned about them. Evidence of specific planning is an indication of serious intent and should instantly be a red flag to take action. Lastly, please go the extra mile to ensure they get professional evaluation from a qualified mental health professional (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist). ii). Community: At the community and public level, public awareness and education to understand suicide and other mental health challenges as well reducing the associated pervasive stigma is helpful. In this regard, the public awareness campaigns by NGOs such as the Suicide Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (SURPIN), as well as the Community Awareness Rallies by the Asido Foundation, are especially helpful. iii). Media: The media also has an important role to play in suicide prevention. Splashing all the gory details should be avoided as much as possible. While it is necessarily important news, such sad occurrences also provide an important avenue to provide education about risk factors and where to seek help. Emphasis should be on the fact that individuals who are depressed, can recover and turn things around in their life\u2026with professional help and treatment. Let us create hope for the living, through action. iv). Schools: The school environment should allow all students to flourish, learn and develop \u2013 regardless of their individual temperaments or dispositions. Bullying, taunting and public humiliations can be devastating for adolescents with fragile egos and low self-esteem. vi). Social Support Network: Lastly, having a support network such as friendly and caring neighbours; religious support groups; close circle of friends and colleagues at work; and involvement in social activities such as sports are also helpful and protective. In conclusion, let us all create hope through positive action everywhere we find ourselves. Not doing anything is simply not an option. Life is precious and irreplaceable.

These activities prompted more than 40 African Region countries to develop national traditional medicine policies by 2022, up from only eight in 2000. Thirty countries have also integrated traditional medicine into their national policies, a 100% improvement from the situation in 2000. Additionally, 39 countries have established regulatory frameworks for traditional medicine practitioners, compared to only one in 2000, demonstrating good governance and leadership. The research institutes dedicated to traditional medicine research and development have employed WHO guidelines and protocols to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of traditional medicine-based therapeutics for priority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes, hypertension, sickle-cell disease and, recently, COVID-19.

The good news is that both conditions are treatable with lifestyle modifications and/or medication. Combining medication that lowers blood pressure with medication that lowers cholesterol such as statin can reduce first-time strokes by 44 per cent. Yet, lots of people stop taking them or using them irregularly because of worries about side effects. Statins are a group of drugs that stop the liver from producing \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.\u00a0 Overtime, its build-up can lead to hardened and narrowed arteries and heart disease \u2014 one of the world\u2019s leading causes of death. Statins also help the body reabsorb any cholesterol built up in the arteries. Now, studies have shown that walnuts can be used to enhance the effectiveness of statins in individuals taking a combined medication that lowers blood pressure with medications that lowers cholesterol such as statins. According to the study, the use of walnut as a statin adjuvant during hypertension treatment reduced LDLc levels by 42.1% and improved HDL levels by 33.6%. There are two main types of cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). HDL cholesterol is considered \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because it helps the body get rid of LDL cholesterol, which is known as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. High levels of LDL cholesterol can double the risk of having a heart attack. Walnuts are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid), which have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health. It is also loaded with folate and vitamin E. The researchers had decided on the clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of walnut as an adjuvant statin in hypertensive subjects because there is the widespread unorthodox use of nuts to improve cardiovascular health. It is documented in the 2022 Clinical and Experimental Hypertension journal. The clinical trial that lasted for three months involved 45 screened hypertensive subjects on treatment, aged 45 to 65 years that were randomised into intervention and placebo groups according to their blood pressure. Fifteen individuals with normal blood pressure were also recruited for this study. The participants in the intervention group included daily 7 g of boiled walnut taken as snacks. The study was not controlled for type of diet and frequency of meals in a day. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) was the primary endpoint for this study.\u00a0 The 2022 study was in the journal, Randomised Controlled Trial. In 2004, researchers in the journal, Clinical Trial Diabetes Care who included walnuts in a diet of patients with type 2 diabetes said it also achieved a significantly greater increase in HDL cholesterol-to-total cholesterol ratio in this group of patients. A 10% reduction in LDL cholesterol was also achieved in the walnut group. This was a parallel randomised controlled trial comparing three dietary advice groups each with 30% energy as fat: low fat, modified low fat, and modified low fat inclusive of 30 g of walnuts per day. Fifty-eight men and women started the trial. Dietary advice was given at baseline with monthly follow-up and fortnightly phone calls for support. Body weight, per cent body fat, blood lipids, HbA1c, total antioxidant capacity, and erythrocyte fatty acid levels were measured at 0, 3, and 6 months. Moreover, there are long-term benefits of taking walnut.\u00a0 Walnut-enriched diet (about half a cup of walnuts every day) improves the lipid profile of blood in individuals with no chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. This beneficial effect was more significant in those with high total cholesterol at baseline. HDL, LDL, and triglycerides \u2014 a type of fat carried in the blood \u2014 make up total cholesterol levels. Significant changes in total cholesterol and fat in the blood were seen and nearly significant changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were found. Many new clinical studies highlight the heart-related benefits of nuts. This includes almonds and peanuts. For example, adding 30 grams (gm) per day of nuts (a little over an ounce) to a Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of heart disease by 30 per cent. Almonds lower LDL in a dose-dependent manner. This means that increasing the number of almonds taken, the further lower the LDL. In only six weeks, people who consumed almonds had lower LDL cholesterol by an average of 5 mg/dL. They also had less belly fat and leg fat.

A UNICEF Health Specialist, Dr Ijeoma Agbo, revealed this while speaking at a two-day media dialogue on the 2021 Multiple Indicator Cluster (MICS) 6 organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Lagos State Directorate, in conjunction with UNICEF. Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) is conducted every two years by the Bureau of Statistics with support from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund to fill the data gap for monitoring the situation of children and mothers\u2019 health. The survey was launched by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on August 16, 2022. The 2021 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, which ranked the Ekiti States lowest in health insurance coverage for women, also ranked Ekiti, Ogun and Oyo states as having the highest infant and child mortality rates. At the dialogue, Agbo revealed that between three and four children die within one month of delivery in Ekiti, Ogun and Oyo states, a development she described as worrisome. She declared: \u201cOnce a child survives the first month of birth, the probability of dying is highest in Ekiti and lowest in Lagos and Osun states.Though Lagos State has the lowest rate of child mortality, there is the need for its government to also do more considering the population. These scorecards are not to castigate the government but a call to action to look at what we are supposed to work on.\u201d In a bid to increase survival rates of children in Ekiti State, she called on the newly sworn-in governor, Abayomi Oyebanji, to prioritise health insurance to cut the state\u2019s infant and neonatal mortalities currently put at 67 per 1000 live births and 53 per 1000 live births respectively, one of the highest in Southwest Nigeria. UNICEF M4R Specialist, Mr Oluwasola Olanipekun, who spoke on an overview of MICS-6 implications across the south-west region, affirmed that 21 percent of children in the region were delivered outside health facilities, thus contributing to child mortality. He added that Ondo State had the highest child mortality in the region, recording 35 percent of deaths between the first and fifth birthday and higher by 12 percent than the South-West average. Earlier, the UNICEF Communication Officer, Lagos Office, Mrs Blessing Ejiofor, said the meeting was to share with the media partners the MICS data on the situation of children and women in South-West Nigeria to inform accurate media advocacy on child rights issues and trigger actions to bridge existing gaps.

Gideon (by SMS)  Experts say the key questions to napping are why you need the daytime rest and how long you snooze. Taking naps can also be a controversial topic. For starters, the need for a nap could signal larger health problems. Among other things, it can mean you\u2019re not getting adequate sleep during the night. It can also be a symptom of dementia in older adults. However, even though it is generally believed that daily napping may be a sign of inadequate nighttime sleep or an underlying health problem, researchers say napping two or three times a week might be good for your heart health. New research has it that napping a few times a week to catch up might help stave off cardiovascular-related incidents, such as heart attack.

Titilayo told the court that she has had enough of her husband\u2019s maltreatment of her and therefore pleaded that it put an end to their union. She also entreated the court to make her husband responsible for the welfare of their five children whose needs she said he had failed to meet over the years. The plaintiff in particular hammered on the defendant\u2019s indifference and uncaring attitude towards their only son, who is physically challenged. According to her, Yekini never paid their son a visit throughout the period he was on admission in the hospital and refused to make any commitment towards paying his medical bills. The plaintiff explained that she solely bore the responsibility of the payment of his medical bills. Yekini did not come to court despite being properly served a hearing notice. Titilayo in her evidence said, \u201cMy lord, I came to court today because I consider divorce as the best way out of the unending woes I have been experiencing in my marriage to my husband. \u201cI work as a labourer to feed the five children I bore with my husband in our marriage because he has refused to carry out his responsibility towards them. \u201cAlthough my husband was my elder brother\u2019s friend, he never gave his consent to our marriage. He vehemently stood against it. \u201cI was headstrong and insisted on having my way. Today, I know better. \u201cYekini promised me heaven and earth when he proposed to me. He pledged and swore by the quoran to take care of me and I believed him, but he failed to keep to his words. \u201cImmediately we got married, he demanded that I started using hijab. I acceded to this not wanting to go against his wish. \u201cMy husband is irrational in his behaviour and reacts to issues in a rage. He fights me when in this mood and punches me. \u201cHe beat me 41 days after I started using hijab and almost killed me. I was rushed to the hospital and put on admission. \u201cMy family members were enraged at his maltreatment of me and demanded that I packed my belongings and moved out of his house, but I was adamant. \u201cMy lord, I denied myself a lot of comfort and saved N83, 000 to buy a piece of land. N80, 000 was meant to purchase the land, while the N3, 000 was aimed at making the corner piece. \u201cYekini being a deceitful and dubious human being collected the money from me, promising to help with the purchase of the landed property. At the end of the day, he neither bought the land nor refunded my money. \u201cAt another time we both put our resources together to purchase two plots of land. We acquired this property at N400, 000. He put down N250,000 while I added N150, 000 to it, but he never told me what has become of this property till date. Titilayo further said that, \u201cMy husband abandoned me and our children after he got a job at Igboora. My thinking was that he would return home at weekends or at least be around twice in a month but he failed to come. \u201cI was disturbed and therefore decided to check on me. \u201cMy lord, on getting to Igboora, I discovered he has taken a new wife and both are living together. \u201cHe was shocked to see me and descended on me with punches for daring to pay him a visit without inviting me. \u201cHe ordered that I returned home, but I insisted on staying back and living with him and his new wife. \u201cYekini treated me with disdain in the presence of his wife. He was always beating me. I finally left for Ibadan feeling battered and sore as a result of the several beatings he meted out to me. \u201cI went against his wishes and stopped using hijab after I returned to Ibadan.\u201d \u201cTitilayo added that, \u201cMy lord, our only son is physically challenged and his health is deteriorating by the day, but my husband has shown no concern. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a dime for the upkeep of our five children. I\u2019m the one feeding, clothing and training them in school. \u201cOur son was on admission in the hospital, but he never came to check on him. I solely bore the responsibility of taking care of him and also paid the medical bills through hard labour. \u201cMy lord, I believe I will fare better without my husband. It is hell going through these unpalatable experiences every day. \u201cI entreat this honourable court to dissolve our marriage and grant me custody of all our children, but make him responsible for their welfare. Mrs S.M Akintayo ordered the defendant to be served another court hearing before adjourning the case.

{"headline": "Why government alone cannot develop rural  communities \u2014 Oba Aderibigbe", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/South-West-3.jpg", "author": "Tribune Online", "posted_date": "Sep 1, 2020", "description": "In this interview by KEHINDE OYETIMI, the paramount ruler of Odo Ayandelu Kingdom, Ikosi Ejinrin, Epe Division of Lagos State, His Royal Majesty, Oba Asunmo Ganiyu Aderibigbe speaks on various issues of both regional and national importance. One of the challenges which I think is daunting is the refusal of people making contributing to the growth of the community. Our forebears and the elderly ones that are around did a lot in the area of community development. We celebrated one of our brothers on Saturday. He did a lot in the development of the community. The same goes to my late father, Alhaji Asumo Balogun. They chose to work with the elders of the community to ensure that our status is raised from baale-ship to obaship. They tarred the road from Agbowa to our community. They also facilitated the provision of electricity here. They also brought in other social amenities, including the primary school. We have a lot of things to do. I need all the support that I can get. There is nothing you can do without money. Look at the school that we built. I donated the administrative block. This was after the Lagos State government said we should start building before it would get involved and take over its running. We used part of the community\u2019s money. Here, in this community, we regard people with lands as land users. We have a committee in that respect. When a land is sold, 40 per cent of the proceed goes back to the community. From such proceeds, we have been able to build a lodge for members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to our community. We renovated the community\u2019s town hall. We renovated the old primary school building. That was where we kick-started our junior secondary school. We also built the female school. At the moment, we are also erecting the community\u2019s palace. Where I reside now is my own personal house. However, it is not good not to have the community palace. We need our indigenes both home and abroad to come back home and join hands together to see how this community can be developed. I must also say that I am enjoying the full cooperation of members of the community living with me at the moment. Yet, I appreciate all the donors that have been helping this community. We have those within and outside the country. I want those in Nigeria to emulate the commitment of those who are outside. There is nothing too small to give back to your community. Look at the palace that we are commissioning very soon. The governor gave me N5 million in this regard but I gave it to the community. I am very grateful to him. Only few people contributed to the building. They should donate and touch the lives of others. In those days our children would trek about seven kilometers to school. We built a school and when government saw it, it was impressed and gave us well furnished laboratories and other aids. The government alone cannot develop all the communities. People must assist government.  I am now a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Building. That is the highest that you can go in that institute. There are many professional bodies in the country at the moment. It was not easy getting it. I had been working on this for a long time. I obtained my ordinary and higher national diplomas at the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos. Before one can become a fellow of the institute, there are stages and criteria to be met. We have the technician stage, graduate stage; if you are not a graduate, there is what we refer to as matured candidate. When you get to the stage of a matured candidate or write an exam, you are expected to face a panel. If successful, you will then be registered as a builder. You can then appendage your approval on any building project which is safe for public use. After obtaining your Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) accreditation, which I got in 2010, you are expected to wait for another ten years after which you will then move to the stage of being a fellow of the institute. I was invited to Abuja in early Match. I went for the interview. I did well and I was given the status of the fellow of the institute. The graduation ceremony was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic. I am the first traditional ruler to become a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Building. It is not honorary. I am grateful to all my friends, family and well wishers. After me, the Emir of Bauchi, by next year, should be the second traditional ruler to be so named a fellow of the institute.  The forum is waxing strong. It is just about two years that we established that forum to bring all Yoruba obas together. Once you are a crowned oba in Yoruba land and duly recognised by government, you are automatically admitted to that forum. The forum has not been relenting in talking to our governors, our Yoruba leaders particularly in guaranteeing the security of our people. Look at the birth of the Western Security Network codenamed operation Amotekun. I said this about four years ago that we need our indigenous security network to provide adequate security for our people. Governors and local government chairmen are given security votes but none for obas. What are the local government chairmen using their security votes for? It is the traditional ruler in that community that is more concerned about the security of his people. It is when our communities are peaceful that we can think of bringing development to our communities. But as traditional rulers, we do not have security votes; we are not empowered. Yet, we will not say that because we are not given security votes we won\u2019t secure the lives and property of our people. All our communities are peaceful; that is why you will see that Lagos State is making progress. Many of our traditional rulers here in Lagos are learned. They know what they are doing. The Yoruba Obas\u2019 Forum has been settling disputes among traditional rulers. We have been working with the Ooni of Ife and the Alaafin of Oyo. They are patrons of the forum. We want the state governors in the south west to join hands with the traditional rulers. They cannot do it alone. You cannot politicise everything; this is why we have crises everywhere in the country. In Lagos here, the governor has been working with us. This is why Lagos is making progress. He has been holding meetings with us. Any governor in any state cannot only relate with political associates. He must also relate and work with his traditional rulers.  That lies with the various governors of the South West. Many of them did not consult many of the traditional rulers. We have 57 local council areas in Lagos State. How many people do you want to involve in these areas? Discuss with the obas and let them be sureties for those that would be employed. If any of these personnel misbehaves, then the oba who stood as guarantor will be held responsible. If you want the agency to work, then you need the traditional rulers, religious leaders. Look at the police force and all the misdemeanors going on there. The governors must work with the traditional rulers.  Government must be prudent in handling the pandemic. It is affecting our economy. The misinformation that is being sold out will affect us investment-wise. At the moment we are confronted with unemployment but the worst is coming. They should look at the economy and foreign investments. Government must look in the direction of private school teachers. They are suffering. When schools are shut, parents won\u2019t pay for services not rendered. But these private school teachers have children and other needs to cater to. I know a teacher who left Ikorodu for my area to get engaged as a bricklayer so as to sustain his family. He would not steal. Our youths must be helped.  The government knows what to do in addressing this. Unfortunately, things are always politicised in our country. Surely we are going to face food crisis. The government must do something about this. Look at the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Youth Development. How many youths have they empowered? The people who really need the money to go into farming are not assisted. I watched the video of a young lady farmer who lamented that because of the inability to purchase feed for her poultry, all the birds are dead. They were told to go into farming. They did, now they are unable to get loan. I pray that God directs our leaders. The Femi Fani-Kayode experience was needless and plainly avoidable. But something tells me it won\u2019t be the last. There is the feeling today in power circles that because of the ascendancy of the Internet and its platforms of social engagements, the press as we knew it is now impotent and could be humiliated and called stupid without consequences. The truth of the media\u2019s undying powers should be clear in what Femi just went through\u2026 President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the transfer of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. A statement signed by the Minister\u2018s Spokesperson, Mrs Uwa Suleiman, on Monday in Abuja, said that the approval was based on Buhari\u2019s consideration for the critical role of NIMC towards the realisation of the objectives of the National Digital Economy Policy and\u2026 BUSINESSES and brands, hoping to return to \u2018winning ways\u2019 soon, after the devastating effects of the COVID 19\u00a0 pandemic, may need to wait a little bit longer, as a recently-released CEO Report, from Philips Consulting Limited PCL,\u00a0 has predicted that it would take another 12 months, August 2021, for the nation\u2019s business environment to fully activate and operate optimally\u2026 The policy execution drive of Mrs Zainab Ahmed, Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, has within this one year into the second tenure of Buhari -led administration, just as it has over the years, consistently helped to take the economy through the frightening months of COVID-19, and also looked to set it on a path to steady growth.

We were subject to scorn and ridicule amongst the committee of towns and communities because of the deteriorating state of our town occasioned by a lack of a leader.

These instrument and staff of office are the only 2 things that every King in Nigeria possesses that gives them their legitimacy and makes them ruler over their people. Since his ascension to the throne of his forefathers, Oba Oyelere has demonstrated uncommon intellect, bravery, leadership and has brought rapid and positive change to Fiditi at a rate we all did not see coming. We thank his Royal Majesty, Alayeluwa Oba Oyelere, for the \u201categun Alafia,\u201d peace and tranquillity that finally began to rein in Fiditi.

The letter, which was signed by His Royal Majesty, Alayeluwa, Oba Sakiru Oyewole Akanni Adekola Oyelere, Ajani -Eedu II, Agbadewolu I, OniFiditi Of Fiditi, was received with great appreciation by the Atobaase who in his acceptance speech said: \u201c Your Royal Majesty, I refer to your offer of appointment letter (and our subsequent discussions) which was written following your meeting with the OniFiditi-in-council, where it was resolved that I be appointed the ASIWAJU OF FIDITILAND.\u201d \u201c After extensive and careful deliberations, I accept this title with humility, gratitude to God almighty, and out of love and respect for your Royal Highness, the OniFiditi-in-council, and all well-meaning people of Fiditi who have deemed me fit for this exhausted position.\u201d The At\u00f3ba\u00e1se further said in the acceptance letter, \u201c Owing to our Yoruba culture, and as discussed and agreed, my title as the At\u00f3ba\u00e1se of Yorubaland, conferred on me by none other than the irreplaceable late Alaafin of Oyo, His Imperial Majesty, Oba (Dr) Lamidi Olayiwola Atanda Adeyemi III, Iku Baba Yeye, J.P, CFR, L.L. D Which covers all Yorubaland, will continue to take supremacy over this title. This is also in line with my discussion with the late Alaafin as a condition for accepting this title.\u201d Based on known facts and evidence, the Asiwaju title is the ultimate honorary traditional title a deserving son can be conferred in a native Yoruba town. The title carries ancient evidence of far-sightedness and positive contributions to the progress of any traditional Yoruba town. It is the rare preserve of those deemed worthy of being so recognized for their achievements and contributions to the development of their people. Dr. Babajide Agunbiade, the Atobaase of Yoruba land, is one of the world\u2019s leading offshore production experts; he is an investor, businessman, and CEO of Alpha Energy Resources, as well as being Executive director of Houston-based National Oilwell Varco, the largest oilfield equipment manufacturing company in the world. He is a fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, a Fellow of the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers as well as being a fellow of the Society of Underwater Technologies. He was conferred with the high-ranking title of Atobaase of Yoruba land by the revered, Imperial Majesty, Oba (Dr.) Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, Iku Baba Yeye, and Alaafin of Oyo at the palace of the Royal Father in Oyo town on the 28th day of August 2021. The title of At\u00f3ba\u00e1se of Yorubaland, which will continue to take precedence, is a Semi-traditional tile. The Atobaase was one of the traditional titles that Alaafin Eguguojo instituted and used to rule the Oyo Empire (now comprising most of Yorubaland) in the 14th century when he moved Oyo to present-day Igboho. In Yorubaland history, the title of At\u00f3ba\u00e1se has been awarded four times in the past, and At\u00f3ba\u00e1se Babajide Agunbiade is the first Atobaase of Yorubaland since 1630 AD. In a related development, the wife of the At\u00f3ba\u00e1se of Yorubaland and newly installed Asiwaju Of Fiditi, Her Majesty, Yeye Olufunke Agunbiade, was also conferred with the title of Y\u00e8y\u00e9 Asiwaju Of Fiditiland by OniFiditi-in-council led by His Royal Majesty, Alayeluwa, Oba Sakiru Oyewole Akanni Oyelere, Ajani -Eedu II, Agbadewolu I, OniFiditi Of Fiditi. We wish the ASIWAJU of Fiditi, HM, Dr. Babajide Agunbiade, The At\u00f3ba\u00e1se of Yorubaland, and Yeye Asiwaju of Fiditi, HM Yeye Olufunke Agunbiade all the best as they juggle their two critical roles.

Speaking during the commissioning of the projects in Uyo, the Chairman, Board of Directors of the company, Dr Elijah Akpan said the gesture becomes imperative because of the peaceful coexistence the company enjoys with the host communities. He said the company remains a promoter of knowledge through its various forms of support to boost learning and enhance quality education. \u201cThis gesture is to enable students to have a good study environment. We are doing this because the host community has given the company the necessary support to thrive. \u201cI encourage all of you to study hard and be excellent in your academic performance. We want you to study hard so that you can take over from us tomorrow,\u201d Akpan added. In his address, the General Manager of Champion Breweries Plc, Mr Inalegwu Adoga commended the state government and the host community for providing a warm and friendly environment for the company to operate. He noted that over the years, the company has been embarking on various developmental projects resulting from a cordial relationship with the host community. \u201cAs a responsible organization that believes in sustainability, we continuously support and partner with our host and neighbouring communities in various developmental projects through our unwavering commitment to corporate social responsibility. \u201cOur interventions over the years are too numerous to read out here, but it suffices to say that we are good neighbours. \u201cIn furtherance of our commitment to improving lives in our communities, we are here today to support the schools with educational materials. \u201cThese include; thousands of branded exercise books, students\u2019 desks and teachers\u2019 tables and chairs to improve the learning experience of the students, boost their morale in their studies and enhance the comfortability of the teachers while adding value to our children,\u201d he noted.

Ezeife also told voters not to reject monies offered to them by politicians. He said the monies were stolen, and by implication, belong to the voters. Speaking while receiving members of the Voters Club of Nigeria (VCN) in his house in Abuja, the former Anambra state governor said if the right person is voted in 2023 as president of the country, within two years, young Nigerians will return from Europe and America to help in the development of the country. \u201cYou cannot have a more important group than yourself, because it is with the votes that we mess up Nigeria. The money they are giving you is your own money, stolen from you, I say it now when they bring money, take it, what controls the world is conscience, when it is time to vote, vote according to your conscience. \u201cWe are poor enough now not to refuse money easily. If you are an effective voter in Nigeria this must change, take money, and vote for the right person. \u201cIt appears that the almighty God in heaven is beginning to smile at Nigeria. If you make the right choice in 2023, after two years, you will find our young brilliant men coming back from Europe, and America with superior investment. God did not create the black man inferior to the white man. \u201cI am begging you to live according to your name and the world will praise you and the people will praise you if it goes well. We are going to take our rightful place in this world\u201d, he said. The VCN decorated the former governor as their grand patron. The National Coordinator VCN, Uche Mbachu said in the 2019 election their members cast 6.8 million votes. He said there has been offline recruitment of voters nationwide. \u201cWe have over 10,000 platforms, as we are talking here in a few minutes\u2019 time, whatever we have done will reach all our members via their phones. We are on social media. \u201cWe made a decision to have a grand patron somebody that will be guiding us, because each time we want to make a move, politicians think we are available to be bought over and when we reject their offer, they start intimidating us. They arrested four of my state coordinators in 2019\u201d, he stated. Mbachu said VCN was formed to give block votes to any candidate of their choice and the choice of candidate is not made by one person, it is made at their national convention. Another reason for the existence of VCN is that the youths find it difficult to win political offices, so they use the number of members to negotiate with politicians on how to carry the youth along when they win. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Coordinator of VCN, Mike Nwosu said they have been in existence since 2010, with 36 million members across the country.

He said, \u201cPeople are more powerful if they\u2019re in an organisation or a group. People in a community will have a common course with which they want to deal with a kind of political party or candidate. If you are a teacher, you will have some ideas of the problem that the education system has.

He emphasised the importance of the constitution as it provides that basic needs should be made available to every citizen by the government in power. \u201cWe call on INEC to deregister, APC and PDP because they do not have a manifesto that is in conformity with chapter two of the Constitution because section 224 of the Constitution provides that political parties registered by INEC must have a manifesto in conformity with chapter two of the Constitution and INEC has failed in its constitutional duty to deregister APC and PDP because INEC is just a tool in the hands of the ruling class,\u201d he said.

Dumebi, while speaking at a town hall meeting in Lokoja, commiserated with the flood victims and families of those who lost their lives and property due to the ravaged flood disaster. \u201dIn 2023, I don\u2019t want you to stay unemployed and suffering; the limestones in Kogi are enough to build 10 cement factories. \u201dWe cannot allow our people to continue to suffer untold hardships; this flood has cost us billions: several lives lost, farmlands and property destroyed. \u201dWe don\u2019t even know the actual number of people who have died because some people have not been able to get to their houses and are possibly dead in those places. \u201dWe must start thinking differently. We must know what we have, and what we can do with the available resources,\u201d he said Dumebi stressed the need to start replanning by going back to the basis where the nation got it wrong. According to him, we need to get experts to come and examine our flood patterns to understand the gravity of flooding in every season; to know what we need to do. He noted that the currently available drainage was grossly not enough, stressing the need to start building proper drainage and dams to ensure that cities were protected. Speaking on the revitalization of Ajaokuta Steel, Dumebi said he would ensure that private sector participants who understand the value of Ajaokuta steel, come and make it work. He emphasised that some vested interests had stopped the steel company from working for years, saying \u201dI will ensure a nation where the law works, and bring the right people to come and take over that asset\u201d. He added: \u201dwe all know that our leaders have all failed us; we are all part of it, so it is a collective failure. \u201dThe only available option to rescue Nigeria is ADC, and I am encouraging Nigerians to support our party. \u201dI come here to hear from you. I want you to tell me your problems, how you have been fairing especially as regards the ravaging flood. The ADC presidential candidate further entertained questions from the participants during the interactive session. Some of the challenges highlighted by the participants include unemployment, economic hardships, bad roads, and the destruction of their farmlands and property by flood, among others. Dumebi assured the people of his commitment and vision to turn things around and alleviate their suffering as well as Nigeria at large. \u201dGod blessed Kogi, especially with numerous natural resources but yet most of the people are struggling in all areas of life. \u201dSuccessive governments have failed because they lacked vision. I am starting my campaign in Kogi because I want to solve your problems first when I become President of Nigeria. \u201dKogi will be my priority; this country belongs to all of us, and it will work for all of us. \u201dWe will explore your water and all other available resources for your benefit. \u201dIf you give me your vote to be the next president of Nigeria, I will turn things around for the benefit of all. \u201dWe must build a rescue mission made up of all of us, you are all important. I am leading a rescue mission and I want everyone onboard,\u201d Dumebi said. He, therefore, urged the people to vote for him and all the ADC candidates at all levels across the state come 2023.

Bamidele described his death as shocking and excruciating and had left a big vacuum that will be herculean to fill in Ekiti and within the progressive fold. Bamidele, in a statement signed on behalf of the 51 Senators, sympathised with the Ekiti State Government, Afuye\u2019s family and political associates, on the loss of this priceless leader, who gave his physical and intellectual resources to develop the state. The forum said; \u201cHon Funminiyi Afuye was one leader that had etched his name in gold in the building of Nigeria\u2019s democratic institution. \u201cHe was patriotic and that necessitated why he put his life on the line fighting the military junta as a member of the defunct National Democratic Coalition (NADECO). \u201cSince the advent of democracy in 1999, the late speaker had also contributed richly to entrench good governance and worked hard to fast track deployment of the instrument of democracy to usher in development and make lives more rewarding for the citizens. \u201cThis was a painful and regrettable death. may his soul find rest in the bosom of the Lord\u201d.

He added that \u201cAppreciably and hopefully, It could be recalled in March 2022, the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development in conjunction with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) organized an entrepreneurial training for the beneficiaries.\u201d According to him, \u201cthe business plans of the beneficiaries were submitted based on the choice of a business that each beneficiary wants, to establish his own business and funds was promised to be disbursed, so for that reason, we are patiently waiting without any protest. \u201cAt this point, the peaceful and law-abiding N-power beneficiaries of Bauchi State on behalf of all N-power beneficiaries in Nigeria are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari, through the office of the Honorable Minster of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development to fulfil its long awaiting promise to N-power volunteers,\u201d he appealed. Umar said that \u201cFinally the beneficiaries are called upon to be prayerful, optimistic and remain calm as we await the disbursement.\u201d While answering questions from Journalists, he denied insinuations that somebody sponsored them to address the Journalists saying, \u201cfor years we have enjoyed a monthly stipend of N30, 000 from the Federal Government, if we cannot say thank you, then we must not embark on any protest to embarrass it.\u201d  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "news", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/bauchi-n-power-beneficiaries-appeal-to-buhari-on-exit-packages/"},

Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki gave the assurance on behalf of State Governors when he addressed the maiden edition of the Broadband Technical Awareness Forum For Governor\u2019s organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on Thursday in Abuja Obaseki said broadband penetration is very vital to improve governance in the states also. He further noted that the regulator must create mutual trust for the Governors to key into the programme. \u201cI want to assure the Minister and the NCC that states are willing and ready to collaborate and work with you. What we need to do is to build more trust a few things happened in the past during Covid 19 MTN wanted to give states like Edo access to more broadband but they didn\u2019t get approvals from the regulator. \u201cWhen the policy of broadband came out five years ago states were allocated certain providers but they didn\u2019t have capacity .For Edo state for instance we decide to bypass the instruction and went to get another deal with a different provider who had capacity that was how we are able to get 400km. \u201cThe points I am making is that we should have an open relationships of trust we have to understand what is going on in States and how they will benefit from internet penetration.\u201d \u201cWe believe there is so such to offer when we work together as subnational and Federal government but how we go about it must be of mutual benefit .There must be openness, trust and put in mind what the states need.\u201d He added. Professor Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, appealed to the state Governors to see beyond the levy on right-of-way \u201cThere is need for is to engage our sub-nationals, our Governors let them understand the benefits of broadband penetration is beyond the right of way. \u201cCertain taxes being collected at the federal government which the states are benefiting the same tax is being collected at the state level. This is the reason why we engaged them so that they will see the benefits of broadband penetration beyond collection of right of way and other charges which are obstacles to broadband penetration in their states\u201d, the Minister said. He also pointed out some of the benefits of broadband penetration in their states. \u201cWhen there is broadband penetration in our states it will go a long way in supporting our security institutions, entire economy ecosystem, schools, citizens to update daily information and news. It is because of this our sub-nationals have a strong role to play. Particularly when they comply with the agreement I engaged them on the 15th of January 2020 under the Nigerian Governor\u2019s Forum. Amen I also engaged the Governors at the National Economic Council. And at least four different times with the challenge of right of way and multiple taxation.\u201d He stated Furthermore, the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the NCC appealed to the 36 state Governors to cooperate with the NCC and the ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to promote the nation\u2019s digital economy drive. \u201cWhen you ask that the journey we have undertaker for almost ten fifteen years or maybe 20 years and the verdict today is we are making progress indeed but we should ask ourselves; is that the kind of progress we would like to see? Or is there room for us to improve what we need to do, in order to reach that destination that we want to reach. Close to 30m Nigerians don\u2019t have access to the internet. And ITU said ICT services should be provided for all; without any discrimination. \u201cWe must deploy infrastructure in a way and manner that will show inclusiveness. And we can only achieve this dream by appealing to their excellencies spearheaded by the Edo State Governor that he should please cooperate with NCC, the Minister and promote digital economy\u201d, he appealed In his explanations on why the state governors need to cooperate with the commission and the ministry he said, \u201cwhen you look at the global broadband infrastructure ecosystem you will find the leading broadband infrastructure nations are those with the highest GDP per capital; these are countries with GDP per capital of between 50-60 thousand dollars. \u201cWe can only better manage our environment when we put broadband infrastructure in place. And above all we will be able to meet our sustainable development goals. There is no goal that doesn\u2019t have ICT component in it; that ICT component can only be accomplished if commensurate broadband infrastructure is put n place.\u201d  ", "newspaper_name": "Nigerian Tribune", "category": "news", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/right-of-way-governors-assure-fg-of-cooperation/"},

{"headline": "Anyaoku: 2023 poll crucial to Nigeria attaining its dream", "image_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/emeka-anyaoku.jpg", "author": "Wale Akinselure", "posted_date": "Oct 21, 2022", "description": "Former Secretary General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku has said the 2023 elections will be a watershed in history, noting that the outcome of the election will be crucial to the nation attaining its dream. To this end, he urged the electorate too, in the 2023 elections, to vote for only those candidates who promise and they believe will prioritise the revamping of the Nigerian governance system. Anyaoku who made his call at the 11th lecture series in his honour themed: \u201cImperative of Good Governance in Nigeria,\u201d held in Ibadan, on Thursday, said a revamp of the present system is central to the development, political stability and achievement of true unity in the country. Noting that the system is crucial to the production of good governance, he beckoned on Nigerians to carefully study the manifestoes of candidates and vote only those they believe will fulfil the promise to revamp the present governance system. He enjoined candidates and political parties to desist from a spate of abuses and personal attacks and rather focus on presenting their manifestoes, policies and plans to make the nation better. He said: \u201cWe have heard a thrilling lecture from Professor Ayo Olukotun who talked about the watershed elections of 2023. Indeed, I agree with you that the 2023 elections will be really a watershed because of their importance to attaining the Nigeria of our dream. \u201cI would urge all our electors, citizens who will be voting in the 2023 elections to vote for only those leaders who would promise to prioritise the revamping of the Nigerian governance system because that would be key to our development, political stability and achievement of true unity in the country.\u201d Speaking further, Anyaoku advocated for fewer and viable federating units and decentralization of the security system, noting that the present system of governance is incongruous with a multi-diverse country such as Nigeria. He advocated that Nigeria look at the governing system of India, which despite its multi-diverse nature, allows its federating units to be largely autonomous and viable. \u201cWe have a system of governance which does not suit a multi, diverse country like ours. We were then a more viable federating unit; there were four federating units as against the 36 plus the federal capital territory that we now have. \u201cIn my view, the present system will not lead us anywhere near achieving the country of our dreams. We need fewer federating units which will be more viable than what we have now. What we have now as federating units makes it easier for us not to have a true federation which is a country of our diverse needs. \u201cThe country that I will like Nigeria to look at, in terms of its governing system, is not the United States of America. The United States of America is essentially an immigrant population; Nigeria, on the other hand, is a country of units that have existed for centuries with their own culture, and manner of living. \u201cWe need a system as the Indians have done so. India is a very diverse country and the diversity of India is being successfully managed because the states of India are largely autonomous in terms of those important aspects of development. \u201cSecurity is crucial for development. If you don\u2019t have security, you will not be able to attract foreign investors. We need to decentralize the management of security too much more viable federating units,\u201d Anyaoku said. Noting that Nigeria was once at par with a country like South Korea, Anyaoku said the country may have missed out on progressing as a nation at the time the military intervened in governance. Anyaoku added: \u201cAgain, picking up from what our lecturer said about our present governance because the system is crucial for the evolution and production of good governance. Nigeria, in the early years of our independence, before the entry of the military to our governance, if Nigeria had remained as it was then before the military stepped in, Nigeria would have been a different country by now. \u201cI remember those were the years when if you took the indices, Nigeria was slightly ahead of Malaysia in development terms. Nigeria was at par with South Korea in development terms but look at those countries today, Nigeria is more than one generation behind them.\u201d Guest lecturer, Professor Ayo Olukotun said the nation continues to be drawn back by institutional decay and the running of institutions without productivity benchmarks and integrity. He said lack of inclusiveness, impunity, lack of respect for the rule of law are the bane of good governance in the country. While stressing that 2023 is a watershed and important to determine the path for Nigeria, Olukotun bemoaned that several candidates campaigning were not talking about how they want to achieve the Nigeria dream. He added that the nation needs a leader that is serious. For the nation to achieve the desired turning point, Olukotun said that there is a need to decentralize the governance system, especially ensuring state police. He noted that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration had fizzled out in attaining its three-point agenda regarding security, economy and fighting corruption. Olukotun, therefore, said there is a need to relaunch the anti-corruption agenda, refocus on ensuring the security of Nigerians and that a serious leader must emerge to handle the nation\u2019s economy. Chairman of the occasion, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun said there was a need to rectify the lack of belief in government and abandonment of ethics in governance. Odigie-Oyegun said: \u201cI want answers to the general sadness in the country over time; it didn\u2019t start yesterday; it didn\u2019t start with this administration. There has been deterioration in the country. There has been an inability to distinguish between white and black. There is growing despair in this country. There is definitely a lack of belief in government in this country. We have taken leave of ethics, and knowledge of right or wrong. So, what is the problem? Where have we gone wrong? What has gone wrong? How can we rectify it?\u201d Host governor, Seyi Makinde said his government epitomizes good governance by running based on transparency and accountability.
