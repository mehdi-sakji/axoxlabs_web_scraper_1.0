I want to tell you that we have arrested a number of those involved in that attack. We are still on the trail of the remaining people. \u201cWe will not let people like that define who we are. This is Anambra State, and we are peaceful people. We must embrace peace, even in the coming election. Anambra is peaceful, Anambra is safe. \u201cWe have chased away bad elements in the state.

DAILY POST recalls that Lawal was on Monday   alongside four others by the Ogun State chapter of the PDP for \u201corganising an illegal primary.\u201d An Abeokuta Federal High Court had on September 27   earlier held by the PDP, asking the party to organise another primary within 14 days. Dissatisfied, the PDP NWC appealed the judgment, wondering how Jimi Lawal and his followers would arrogate to themselves powers of the national body of the party by writing INEC and holding the so-called primary election. \u201cWe write to draw the attention of the Commission to a purported primary election conducted by some persons claiming to be State Executive Members of our party, allegedly held on Monday, 17th October 2022, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State Capital. \u201cThis is coming days after the 14 days ordered by the Federal High Court for the party to conduct a fresh primary election. \u201cThe 14 days ordered by the Federal High Court, Abeokuta division within which the party was to conduct a fresh primary election lapsed on Tuesday, 10th October, 2022, and no fresh Primaries was conducted in Ogun State, the party having resolved to go on appeal and rightly so. \u201cThis, being our position, we were surprised to read both on print media and online media that some persons claiming to be part of a faction of the party conducted a fresh primary on behalf of the party on Monday, 17th October, 2022, 7 days after the 14 days ordered by the Federal High Court, Abeokuta division which the party appealed against has lapsed,\u201d Ayu said. In a copy of the letter acknowledged by the office of the INEC National Chairman on October 20, Ayu said, \u201cSection 50 of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party (as amended in 2017) empowers the National Working Committee acting on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) to formulate guidelines and regulations for the nomination of candidates for election into public offices at all levels and shall be the final authority for resolving all disputes relating to the choice of candidates for the party for any election and for conveying to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) or any other authority to whom it may concern, confirming the names or list of names of candidates of the party in any elective office in the federation. This section enjoys a plethora of judicial backings.\u201d In the letter co-signed by Ayu and the National Secretary of the party, Samuel Anyanwu, the party called the attention of the electoral umpire to the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022, saying, \u201cThe Act provides that all correspondences between the Commission and political parties must be signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the party and not State Executives.\u201d Ayu said: \u201cWe are by this letter, notifying the commission of this illegality and to further inform the Commission that the National Working Committee is dissociating itself from the said fresh primary election conducted by persons other than the National Working Committee. We do not recognize these persons involved in this illegality. \u201cIn view of the foregoing, the Commission is advised to refrain from accepting any letters or correspondences written on behalf of the party by any State Executive of Ogun State and should be circumspect in its dealings with these persons in the future.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/2023-pdp-chairman-ayu-disowns-jimi-lawal-says-no-fresh-primary-in-ogun/"},

In the shooting caught on camera, police operatives fired at supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The incident reportedly occurred at the party\u2019s campaign office in Gusau, the capital, on Thursday, the End SARS second anniversary. A banner on the building shows the images of PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and Zamfara governorship flagbearer, Dauda Lawal. In a trending video, the police team targeted a number of youths standing meters away and discharged shots. A young man was later grabbed and dragged to a pick-up truck. The video ends as officers try to put him in the vehicle; one knelt to shoot again. In reaction, some citizens accused Matawalle of giving the order.

The Apex Court presided over by Justice Amina Adamu Augie struck out the request following the dramatic withdrawal of a motion to that effect by Chief Paul Erokoro SAN who was counsel to Ogba. At Friday\u2019s proceedings, Erokoro, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria had attempted to argue for a prayer for the Supreme Court to review its earlier judgment which recognized Ifeanyi as the PDP governorship candidate. However, following the mood of the Court to the request, the senior lawyer beat a retreat and dramatically withdrew processes filed on behalf of his client when it became apparent that the Apex Court would not yield to the request. Following the withdrawal, Justice Amina Augie struck out the request. Before the withdrawal, counsel to Chukwuma Ifeanyi, Chief Chris Uche, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN, had vehemently opposed the request of the factional governorship candidate on the grounds that it constituted a gross abuse of the Supreme Court. Uche who led a team of senior lawyers in the matter, had prayed the court to uphold its finality policy as the highest court in the land, adding that any attempt to grant the request of Ogba will not augur well for the judiciary. The senior lawyer pleaded with the Apex Court to turn down the request on the grounds of being frivolous, unmeritorious, and a strange invitation that must not be honoured by the court. The Supreme Court had on September 14, 2022, in its final judgment in an appeal marked SC/CV/939/2022 affirmed Chukwuma Odii Ifeanyi as the authentic PDP governorship candidate having emerged from a primary election conducted by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. The court had struck out an appeal on the grounds that the issue of nomination of candidates for elective office is an internal affair of political parties and that no court has jurisdiction to entertain it.

DAILY POST reports that this is in sharp contrast with what happens in other States where the gubernatorial candidates head the presidential campaign council of their various States in the absence of a governor.

Since the party\u2019s governorship primary election which did not go down well with the majority of the aspirants, the party has been facing a crisis. This was followed by various pre-election matters instituted against the party\u2019s governorship flagbearer in both Jalingo and Abuja Federal High Court. While a court in Jalingo has nullified the primary, warning the candidate to desist from parading himself as the party\u2019s flagbearer, that of Abuja has set next month for ruling.

LP made the remark while accusing the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and All Progressives Congress, APC, of failing the Nigerian youths and making it difficult for them to pursue their dreams. Moses Ogidi-Paul, the Assistant National Youth Leader of LP, spoke in a statement to mark the second year anniversary of the EndSARS Lekki Tollgate massacre. Ogidi-Paul warned that a victory for either APC or PDP would further crush the will of the Nigerian youths. The member of the LP Presidential Campaign Council said: \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have failed the Nigerian youth. They have made it difficult for the Nigerian youth to dream or pursue their dreams. One cannot bear to imagine how easily Nigerian students excel abroad with some breaking decades-old academic records. \u201cThe reason is simply because opportunity was denied at home. Nepotism would deny them scholarship. Tribalism will make employment impossible. Religion will kill them on the street. This is the pitiable situation we live in that has kept many young people from reaching their potentials with some turning to crime as a result. \u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that Nigeria at this moment in our history needs an overhaul of our entire ideological architecture to reflect democratic tenets of justice, equity, fairness and respect for the rule of law if we must make any headway in the search for our nation\u2019s soul. This must be by a system that recognises the stakeholding of the youth of Nigeria. \u201cThe current electioneering cycle has further affirmed the position of the youth of Nigeria on the leadership of the country and how much they matter in it. The vibrant and massive support of the youth for the presidential bid of Mr. Peter Gregory Obi of the Labour Party and his running mate, Dr, Yusuf Ahmed-Baba Datti, has stretched their voices beyond the #endsars protest into the future for which that march was made. Little wonder youth in leadership and development is a pivotal theme of the ObiDatti Campaign. We have seen this in the recent appointment of spokespersons and other campaign council members. \u201cThere is no doubt that a Peter Obi presidency will reignite hope in the hearts of the young people of Nigeria everywhere in the world. And a nation in search of its soul will finally find it with the youth leading the way. I call on all young people of Nigeria, everywhere they may be in the world, to make the realisation of the ObiDatti presidential bid their personal project. A victory for PDP or APC will retain the old system in power and further crush the will of the youth. \u201cWe must rise above their whims and schemes, above bribery and inducements, above intimidation and other vices targeted at subverting the will of our people at the polls. Don\u2019t be a by-stander. Be involved. Go get your PVC, encourage someone to get theirs, and please, vote and protect your votes. \u201cThis is what our comrades died for, at Lekki Toll gate and other locations across the country. \u201cThis is why we remember today, that from the ashes of their sacrifice a new Nigeria will rise and no Nigerian will ever be gunned down by a Nigerian policeman or soldier. They died so we may see today, the emergence of a new Nigeria from a Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti victory at the ballot next year. This is the only way we can trace the blood trails to freedom. Rest in peace dear comrades. Your sacrifice will not be in vain.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/20/endsars-lekki-tollgate-victims-died-for-peter-obis-emergence-pdp-apc-failed-moses-ogidi-paul/"},

He noted that he visited Izzi LGA to address his teaming supporters ahead of the forthcoming general election in the State. He expressed regret that the venue of the event was locked up by the council chairman of Izzi LGA to prevent him from addressing stakeholders and supporters in the area. According to him: \u201cWe have a visit to Izzi LGA because Izzi is part of Ebonyi State. We have our supporters in Izzi because it is one of the 13 LGAs of the State. We have our campaign office there. \u201cAs early as 6:00 a.m. this morning, I started receiving distress calls. One of our coordinators called and said that the chairman of Izzi LGA called and warned him that no event will take place in the local government, that he is under pressure from the State government. \u201cThe DPO also called and raised the same alarm, that he is under enormous pressure that we shouldn\u2019t come. I\u2019m the Gubernatorial candidate of APGA in Ebonyi, and I\u2019m in this race to govern everybody in the State, therefore, if I can\u2019t go to Izzi, then it means that, I\u2019m not qualified to stand election. \u201cOn reaching Izzi LGA, we were confronted by Ebubeagu operatives. They shot at one of our cars, you can see it and the glass shattered. We went there with official security men, the police, the DSS, together with our campaign team. \u201cThe governor David Umahi can\u2019t force everyone, he should allow the people of the State to choose for themselves.

In previous years, after two weeks, the flood usually recedes, giving victims who may have relocated to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps the opportunity to move back to their homes. This year\u2019s flooding which began in Anambra one month ago has not shown any sign of receding, just as more homes are being submerged on a daily basis, swelling the number of victims who are relocating to IDPs camps daily. A recent visit to two IDPs camps in Anambra East Local Government Area showed the level of pain most of the victims were undergoing. In Umuoba Anam, hundreds of people were seen living in a hall, owned by a school. While some had mattresses to sleep on, many others, especially women and children, used pieces of clothes spread on the floor. A flood victim, who spoke to journalists; Mr Emmanuel Okonkwor said: \u201cI am saddened over the condition of the victims here. They lay on bare floor, and most of them are yet to receive anything from the government except what some individuals brought. They also need money to buy condiments, kerosene and firewood to make the food which people eat once a day.\u201d In Mmiata Anam, Mrs Tina Okeke said she has been sleeping on the floor with her six children since the flood set in and forced them to relocate to the camp, while also saying that hunger has been a major challenge to them. Meanwhile, the high number of deaths in the flood prone areas has been attributed to the unwillingness of most rural farmers to leave their farms. A farmer in the area, David Ogbonna, who spoke to DAILY POST during a visit to the flood prone area said: \u201cYou won\u2019t understand, but it is difficult to just enter the boat and be taken to upland areas, when you know that you have a house, and properties that you will be leaving behind. \u201cSometimes, these government people just provide a boat to rescue you, but the truth is that we consider the things we are leaving behind. Sometimes, when you leave and water recedes, thieves may raid your house, even your crops in the farm.\u201d Offering another perspective, a candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Mrs Peace Obimuonso said the human casualty being experienced as a result of the flood could have been averted if the people were guaranteed of a good camp with amenities, food, water and other basic needs. \u201cAll these deaths could have been averted if the people were sure of the source of their next meal. Most times, the farmers borrow money from local money lenders, which if they fail to pay back when due, attracts heavy consequences. But because they know that leaving their homes and going to live as refugees in camps was not the best, they now stay back to see what they can salvage of their crops.\u201d DAILY POST, however, gathered that efforts were in top gear by farmers in Omor, Ayamelum Local Government Area, to rescue their crops from flood. Mr Ejike Sunday, who spoke to our correspondent in Awka said: \u201cI\u2019m going to the village. We have a meeting, and we hope to commence an operation to rescue our crops. The Government doesn\u2019t know what our people go through when a flood comes. They just hope that you will quickly move to IDPs camps, but our people are basically farmers. The crops we have spent time, energy and money growing will be underwater. It is hard to leave. \u201cSome people took loans to farm for the year, what will you tell the lenders? So, there is a meeting in the village to see how we can rescue some crops. The tendency is that most farm produce may be harvested earlier than normal, to avoid being further destroyed by flood.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/flood-devastation-persists-victims-count-losses-in-anambra/"},

Ohanaeze spoke in reaction to a statement being circulated on social media attributed to one Igboayaka Igboayaka who claimed that the Delta State Governor and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Vice Presidential candidate, Ifeanyi Okowa was owing Ohanaeze N200m. However, in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday by the National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, he said it was desperation and mischief taken too far for anyone to make such claims. While warning that the Ohanaeze should not be used for such spurious and paid jobs, Okwu said there was nothing like N10m monthly dues in Ohanaeze, let alone Okowa owing accumulation of such dues. \u201cTo set the records straight, there is nothing like payment of N10m dues by anyone or Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. \u201cContributions and support to Ohanaeze are made as people are led and not by any compulsory levy. \u201cIt is also apt to state here that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State are unarguably the highest funders of Ohanaeze during the immediate past Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership. \u201cThe records are there for anyone to see and till date, they have not abandoned the Ohanaeze Ndigbo. It is, therefore, puerile for someone who is completely unknown in Ohanaeze to wake up and make such claims. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has always been and remains a true Igbo son with whom we are well pleased. We shall also continue to support and identify with him,\u201d Okwu said. He urged Okowa not be dampened by the activities of such attention seekers, stressing that \u201cas we approach the 2023 general elections, the members of the public should be prepared to see such elements spring up and tarnish people\u2019s image merely because of crumbs being thrown their way by desperate politicians.\u201d Similarly, the spokesman of Ohanaeze, Chief Alex Ogbonna had also described the said Igboayaka as an entity unknown to the apex Igbo group.

In Akamkpa and Biase Local Government areas, countless mining firms, as well as illegal miners prospect for natural resources, tearing open lands wantonly, but frequently do not declare what minerals they have discovered. These have often caused frictions between them and local communities who feel cheated and raped, which reason amongst others the State government banned mining activities recently. Speaking on behalf of other affected traditional chieftains of other neighbouring communities, the clan head of Akpet Central in Biase LGA of the State, Adolphus Sunday Evong said miners should no longer ill-treat mining host communities as if they did not matter, or take them for fools. In an interview on the sideline of the workshop organised by the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office in the federal ministry of mines and steel development, for stakeholders in the South-South on the adoption of the electronic mining Cadastre System, the clan head said, \u201cThe situation where they exploit our resources and leave us bare, we are not going to accept such deprivations any longer.\u201d Expressing unhappiness, Evong said, \u201cThe natural resources they mine from our communities were given to us by God. So, they must carry the people along. \u201cThe host communities should also enjoy what comes out from their lands. The poverty level in my community, for instance, is very high. So a situation where miners come and extract resources, enrich themselves without commensurate compensations is not fair at all, and not acceptable any more.\u201d According to him, they have nothing to show from the extraction of natural resources from their lands. He said, \u201cWe have no light, no water, no decent houses, no roads. Yet they are basking in opulence from our resources; building mansions here and everywhere. Should we continue to allow that? \u201cAnother thing that has made us very angry and it is very painful, too, is that these miners hardly declare what types of mineral resources they have discovered on our lands. \u201cThey will continue to exploit and extract and make fortunes, leaving us in abject poverty. \u201cHenceforth, we want to know the type of minerals they have discovered from our lands. We want the miners to give host communities good percentages of the resources they mine so that we can use such to develop our communities.\u201d Reacting, a Chief Executive Officer of a mining firm in the State, Lady Diamond Sekibo insisted that as licensed miners they do declare what minerals they prospect for, and hoped that ongoing meetings with the authorities to resolve many issues will be worthwhile. \u201cAs licensed miners, we are by law bound to declare the types of mineral resources we discover in any given community. It should be noted that the types of minerals to be mined are usually listed on one\u2019s licence. \u201cIt is the illegal miners that indulge in covering up what they have discovered from their prospecting,\u201d she said. She lamented that they are facing huge challenges, among which is multiple taxation. \u201cWe do not even know where they are all coming from. We sincerely hope that the government will look into them with a view to streamlining them. \nMany of us have been badly affected by the recent order by the State Government banning mining activities in the State. \u201cWe are happy that we are resolving the issues with the government, so as to avoid further losses,\u201d she added.", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/cross-river-community-leaders-battle-mining-firms-over-undeclared-prospects/"},

Hours later, the police told the public that minimal force was used to   who had gathered for the memorial procession. On October 27, 2020, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army (NA) said the Lagos government   to intervene during the October 20 protests. The Army revealed that this was after a curfew was imposed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Brig. Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, then Commander, 81 Military Intelligence Brigade in Victoria Island, appeared before the Lagos Judicial Panel. Taiwo told the commission that hoodlums had taken over the metropolis and overran police teams across the state. The General said the scenes of the carnage that followed the toll gate shooting were reminiscent of the Liberian Civil War. \u201cIt was these incidents that made the Governor of Lagos State to ask for military intervention. \u201cIn my opinion, that was the correct thing to do since the police had been overrun and policemen were fighting for their dear lives\u201d, Taiwo noted. The Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and other Matters indicted the military and the Lagos government.
