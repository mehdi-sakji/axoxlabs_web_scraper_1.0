Amosun, who represents Ogun Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) recently expressed his support for Otegbeye while speaking on BBC Yoruba programme.  The support for opposition governorship candidate has, however generated controversy and caused some panic within the APC circle and the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has reacted saying he would not be deterred by the move.  Adebajo who spoke to reporters in Abuja described Amosun\u2019s move as patriotic, adding that \u201cOtegbeye is a man of high integrity.\u201d According to Adebajo, Otegbeye is an accomplished lawyer and a successful Chartered Insurer with a Masters Degree in Finance Management, has been described as an attempt to revive a culture of excellence in leadership that Ogun state is known for.  He noted that Amosun has shown an uncommon consistency and unwavering commitment to ensure the emergence of a governor of Yewa-Awori extraction.  \u201cSince the creation of Ogun state in 1976, no one from Ogun West, which is populated by Yewa-Awori people, has been elected governor while the position has been rotated between the other two Senatorial Districts, Ogun East and Ogun Central. \u201cFormer Governors of the state have verifiable educational background unlike Governor Dapo Abiodun whose educational background is enmeshed in controversies. In 2015, Abiodun claimed he graduated from the University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University. However, in 2019, he said he did not graduate from the same institution. \u201cIf discipline and dogged determination had a face, it would be Senator Ibikunle Amosun and Barrister Biyi Otegbeye. The two have shown levels of resilience, courage and persistence in their political career. \u201cWithout doubt, Amosun has shown a great level of courage and conviction in aligning with Asiwaju Bola Tinubu\u2019s unity agenda. Since Otegbeye\u2019s ADC party recently suspended and expelled its Presidential Candidate, this move has given Otegbeye a reason to show a total support for Tinubu just as Amosu. The three chords are complete with Tinubu in the centre: Tinubu, Amosun and Otegbeye\u201d, Adebajo noted. Comparing the harmony between President Muhammadu Buhari  and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo with that of Amosun and Otegbeye, the ADC chieftain said in them Ogun people have found men of honour. \u201cThe way Osinbajo and Buhari have managed their faith devoid of religious rancour can be likened to the chord that binds Amosun and Otegbeye. The former are bound by unity of faith. Same value system also binds Amosun and Otegbeye, irrespective of their actual stance. Their synergy is dynamic in its diversity. \u201cThe good people of Ogun state have found favour in the sight of God with the gift of Asiwaju, Amosun and Otegbeye, an alliance that will become political thematic for further studies. These patriots are genuine loyalists: their commitment to people and to a good cause does not depend on favours or benefits. Amosun\u2019s support for Otegbeye is solely because he has seen what others have not seen: a fertile land who is ready to serve the people of Ogun state. This coalition and affinity are examples of unity of purpose. \u201cThis unexpected decision is still causing some uproar in Ogun State, owing from Amosun\u2019s known affection for Adekunle Akinlade. Since the latter defected to PDP and Amosun decided to take his hands off the political wheels of Akinlade and people began reflecting on the connecting dot between Amosun and Otegbeye, the glaring similarities between these two no doubt, must have led to this unanticipated political marriage.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/2023-election-adc-chieftain-backs-amosun-on-support-for-otegbeyes-ogun-state-governorship-bid/"},

Osinbajo expressed this view on Friday in Abuja while performing the inauguration of the Seeds for Future Foundation and Education Grant\u2014an initiative of Olam Agri. Olam Agri is a leading agribusiness firm focused on high-growth consumption markets. The vice president said that through the seeds of the future programme, Olam had invested in two important types of seed. \u201cFirst, the seeds you are planting by investing in the education of our young people through the education grant initiative for undergraduates. \u201cThe second of course, is the very successful award-winning wheat seeds trial project which I am told achieved its first peer milestone of producing 10 kilograms of pre-multiplication wheat seeds varieties and was showcased by the UN General Assembly at the climate summit and nominated for an international grant. \u201cBut I think it is seeds that you plant by investing in our agricultural value-chain\u2014from research to people especially disadvantaged women\u2013that has attracted even greater attention leading to the National Productivity Order of Merit Award which was presented to Olam by President Muhammadu Buhari. \u201cThe planting of these seeds shows your firm belief in our country and its innovative and how it is that the story of our country will  ultimately yield fruits of prosperity, peace and decent livelihood for all.\u2019\u2019 He said considering that Olam started off in Nigeria, few years ago and had grown to 60 different countries, it was evident that Nigeria\u2019s soil was very fertile. Osinbajo said it also entailed that the seeds that were planted in Nigeria were very prolific. \u201cI do not think that there is any other business that demonstrates the importance of faith, patience, resilience and hope as agriculture does. \u201cPlanting seeds, tending them until they create food, wealth and sound health for all. \u201cSo, it is an absolute pleasure to see how these important attributes now form the values for the Seeds for the Future Foundation. \u201cAnd the Seeds for the Future Foundation espouses the same values through its various interventions; very well done indeed.\u2019\u2019 Osinbajo applauded Olam Agri for the hard work and commitment it had put in agricultural and food processing in Nigeria especially. He listed areas where the firm had excelled as  wheat-milling, rice farming and milling, tomato farming, hatchery, soya bean processing, agricultural export\u2014cocoa, beans, cashew nuts and sesame seed. \u201cI think that one of the very important things that we learn from the hard work that you put into agriculture and food processing is that this is really where the potential of our country lies. \u201cThis is really where the wealth of our country lies, not just in the extractive industry but more in agricultural value chain especially export of manufactured and processed goods. \u201cI think that here, we have a  very strong advantage and I am told that aside oil and gas, Olam comes close second in terms of exports and I think this is very commendable indeed,\u2019\u2019 he said. The vice president commiserated with Olam Agri over the monumental loss occasioned by the flooding of Olam Rice Farm in Nasarawa State. Earlier in his welcome speech, Ashish Pande, Senior Vice President and Country Head, Olam Agri, said that the firm was born in Nigeria and was eager to create the best seeds for the tropical nation. According to him, Olam Agri is diversifying from seeds development to human development hence the Seeds for Future Foundation. \u201cThe foundation works on four different levers; it talks about working on farmers and farmers associations, it talks about education and sports development. \u201cIt talks about women empowerment and finally, being a food company, it talks about promoting health and nutrition for the population,\u2019\u2019 he said. Osinbajo was earlier led on an exhibition tour by Olam Agri officials. The highlight of the event was the unveiling of the Seeds for the Future Memorabilia.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/nigerias-wealth-lies-more-on-agri-value-chain-osinbajo/"},

The former senator slammed his former political ally over \u2018the church rat and poisoned holy communion\u2019 comment made by the one-time governor of Lagos at the Arewa Interactive Committee on Monday in Kaduna. Recall that Tinubu, while fielding questions about climate change at the event, described climate change as \u201ca question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating poisoned Holy Communion.\u201d \u201cWe are a poor nation. They say firewood is not for fetching. They say we need to plant more trees and they are not giving us money. We need to tell the West, if you don\u2019t guarantee our finances and work with us to stop this, we are not going to comply with your climate change,\u201d Tinubu said. But reacting to Tinubu\u2019s claim about climate change, Melaye, in a news release made available to The Guardian, described the APC presidential aspirant\u2019s comments as \u201cunguarded\u201d and accused him of insulting Christians. \u201cThe APC presidential candidate, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, plunged into new depths of desecration when, by an unguarded and unrelated flow of thought, he despised the body of Christ by profaning the sacrament of communion and besmirching the church,\u201d read the statement in part. \u201cIn the same breath, he trivialised the existential threat that climate change poses to humanity. \u201cFurthermore, he fell out of tune with world leaders in ways that betrayed a lack of understanding of what the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr called the \u2018Fierce Urgency of Now\u2019,\u201d said Melaye, referring to the famous speech the late American civil rights leader delivered at a March in Washington in the late 1960s where he reminded a divided United States that \u201cwe need one another, and that we are stronger when we march forward, together.\u201d Melaye also accused Tinubu, a two-term governor of Lagos, of having a \u201climited understanding\u201d of what governance entails. \u201dHaving overlooked Christians in his choice of a running mate, he further rubbed insult on injury by calling in the Holy Communion into an unrelated conversation,\u201d continued Melaye. \u201cIt would have been honourable for Tinubu to simply admit that he didn\u2019t know what climate change is. \u201cAgain, that exposed his limited understanding and poor preparation for governance. Any leader of any great nation who does not understand the basics of climate change, especially with the ongoing flooding in Nigeria and the economic conflict arising from farmers and herders, has no business aspiring to lead our dear country at this moment. \u201cBesides, Nigerians who have been in doubt about the presence of mind and the physiological capacity of Tinubu to preside over the affairs of Nigeria should now be convinced that he is not fit. For a moment, his thought processes tripped and he launched into another issue entirely. Nigerians could imagine if what happened in Kaduna had happened on the world stage. As I said earlier, Nigerians cannot afford to gamble with the next election.\u201d Melaye then went ahead to explain why his principal, Atiku Abubakar, would be a better choice for president than Tinubu or any other candidate in the race to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari. \u201cAn Atiku presidency will not only be at home with global issues anywhere and anytime, he would build bridges and partnerships to address contemporary and emerging issues with pace, purpose and patience,\u201d he said. He added that Atiku \u201cwill collaborate with others to contain the causes and effects of climate change and, more importantly, he will work for structures that will help Nigeria to build the resilience and adaptation to climate change, particularly in climate smart agriculture and other strategic initiatives.\u201d \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/holy-communion-climate-change-comments-show-tinubu-not-fit-for-president-says-melaye/"},

For more than three months, Atiku and the PDP are yet to reconcile with Wike who said he is opposed to a \u2018northern domination\u2019 within the party. Wike insists that the PDP chairman Iyorchia Ayu must resign for a person from southern Nigeria since Atiku, another northerner is the PDP presidential candidate. Amid continued efforts to reconcile their differences, Wike has met with members of opposition parties \u2013 the Labour Party and its presidential candidate Peter Obi and the chieftains of the ruling APC. While Wike is yet to publicly give his support to Atiku, the decision of the Rivers governor to dump the PDP candidate in Lagos Olajide Adediran, appears to have set the tone for a likely political alliance with Tinubu. Wike told journalists at the conference that the next president Nigeria needs is one with the interest of Nigerians, experience in governance, tackle insecurity and \u201cnot people talking about ethnicity\u201d, a statement that appears to be a veiled shot at Atiku who earlier said \u201can average northerner needs is somebody who\u2019s from the North not a Youruba or Igbo candidate.\u201d Reacting to Wike\u2019s call for an apology for the \u2018divisive\u2019 statement, a spokesperson for Atiku\u2019s presidential campaign Osita Chidoka said Atiku does not need to apologise because the comment does not warrant such. \u201cI think we need to move beyond these political gimmicks and political gimmickry that goes on when people say one thing, we turn it the other way round and we use it for political ends,\u201d Chidoka said on Channels Television programme on Tuesday.

On the possibility of Wike supporting Tinubu for the presidential election, Chidoka noted that \u201cit is consistent with his character. He has done it before and he is doing it now in Lagos State. \u201cif he wants to support the presidential candidate of any party, he is free to do so but he has a moral responsibility not to be sitting on a PDP seat as a governor and be talking about another candidate. \u201cThat moral burden is more on Wike than it\u2019s on PDP to justify why he is taking that position for a party that has been good to him from local government chairman to being the governor of a state.\u201d Chidoka, however, noted that Atiku and the PDP will continue to engage Wike on the issues and do not consider him a \u201clost cause\u201d. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/2023-presidency-wikes-endorsement-of-apcs-sanwo-olu-may-be-sign-of-what-to-come/"},

The Ogun East born politician and ally of Governor Nasir El Rufai of Kaduna State, who defected to the PDP in February this year to contest the governorship primary, was on Monday, suspended along with four others; Bola Odunmosun, the Financial Secretary of the party, Fasiu Ajadi, Kola Akinyemi and Tope Asiru, the party chairman of Ijebu North East local government area of the state. Following a Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta that nullified the primary election of the party, which produced Mr. Ladi Adebutu in the state, Lawal and others, had organised another primary on Monday October 16, after the expiration of the 14 days grace granted to the party to organise another rerun primary. The presiding judge, Justice\u00a0O.O. Oguntoyinbo in her judgment ordered the party to conduct fresh primaries within 14 days. The judgment also precluded the national body of the PDP from holding or organising the rerun primary, it rather ordered the state executive to handle it. The court also barred the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from recognising\u00a0Adebutu as the governorship candidate of the party in the state. Ladi Adebutu But the content of the Federal High Court judgment does not go down well with the National Working Committee (NWC) and the State Executive chapter led by Mr. Sikirulahi Ogundele. Ogundele had on Saturday told\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0that the party would appeal the judgment on the basis that though PDP has no issue with the cancellation of previous primaries and the directives to organise a rerun, the bone of contention, according to him is the aspect, which says the state executive should be the one to organise fresh primaries. According to Ogundele, \u201cThe judgment was against the Constitution of PDP, which empowers the national body and not state executive, to organise primaries especially the governorship primary.\u201d He noted further that if the state executive should go ahead to organise the primaries as directed by the Federal High Court, the outcome of such exercise would be subjected to another litigation because some people would head to the court to say that the state executive does not have such constitutional power, in line with the party\u2019s rule and the Electoral Act 2022, to organise primaries. \u201cThis is what we are trying to avoid, which caused a delay before the 14 days directives expired. But that does not mean all is over because we still have enough time going\u00a0by the Electoral Act 2022, to resolve the matter,\u201d he said. He disclosed that NWC of the party had appealed the judgment. But following the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum, the faction of Jimi Lawal staged a factional governorship primary election in Abeokuta, the state capital on Monday. The Guardian learnt Lawal and his co-travellers went ahead to\u00a0conduct the court-ordered rerun primaries across the state.\u00a0While the governorship rerun election took place at the DLK Event Centre, the National Assembly and State House of Assembly primaries were held in the various constituencies. At the end of the governorship rerun, Lawal emerged the gubernatorial candidate with 456 votes.\u00a0Announcing the results, the State Financial Secretary, Hon. Bola Odumosu, who led other members of the State Executive Committee to conduct the court-ordered rerun, said a total of 463 delegates were accredited to vote. Of the number, seven votes were voided. The trio of Honourable Ladi Adebutu, Otunba Segun Sowunmi and Mr. Abodunrin John Abimbola were given zero votes. Sikirulai Ogundele Organisers of the rerun primaries said the Federal High Court judgment gave\u00a0them the power to do what they\u00a0did.\u00a0 They claimed that the Federal High Court, Abeokuta, had in two judgments delivered on the 27th of September 2022, in Suit No. FHC/AB/CS/87/22 and Suit No. FHC/AB/CS/83/22, ordered the State Executive Committee of the PDP in Ogun State to conduct fresh primaries within 14-days. However, the defendants filed an application for stay of execution at the trial court in respect of the two judgments, which were determined on Thursday, 13th October 2022. While the application in respect of Suit No. FHC/AB/CS/87/22 was dismissed, the one in respect of Suit No. FHC/AB/CS/83/22 was withdrawn by the defendants/applicants (i.e. PDP and Adebutu). Odunmosun, who led a faction of the state executive that conducted the rerun primary, said the development paved the way for the state executive committee to comply with the court order while the judgment debtors pursue their appeals. But in a swift reaction, Secretary of the party in the state, Sunday Solarin, announced the suspension of all those that participated in the rerun primaries. He disclosed that Lawal and the others were suspended for violating the constitution of the party by conducting and participating in an \u201cillegal\u201d governorship primary election which was not authorised by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Solarin disclosed that Lawal and others have been suspended for one month pending the outcome of a disciplinary committee, which would be setup to review their action. The leadership of the party in the state also condemned the action of Lawal and members of his faction, insisting that PDP would not condone any action directed at putting the party into disrepute. According to Solarin, \u201cAll of these shenanigans will be put to rest and we have resolved that the principal actors of the illegal primary election will be exposed. They have been found to have transgressed the laws of the party and their punishment will be given. \u201cWe were informed that an illegal congress was going to happen today and that history has it as of this afternoon that some people gathered somewhere to carry out an action that is not constitutionally or statutorily assigned to them. \u201cWe have also resolved today that Otunba Jimi Lawal is going to be on suspension with immediate effect because he participated actively in a congress not conducted by the State Executives of the party, an action which has been found to bring the party into disrepute. \u201cWe must also emphasis the fact that in a house where discipline is missing, definitely such a house will not raise good children and they are not going to raise a good ambassador for that family. \u201cBecause PDP is a house that believes in the rule of law, it is a house built by our forefathers, managed by all of us, we are not going to open our eyes and allow some dissidents to destroy the house and therefore we must toe the path of discipline by showing them the way. So, they are suspended for the next one month in which case the disciplinary committee will be setup and they will be invited to come and explain the action they took, the reason their suspension will not be elongated or why it will not translate into expulsion.\u201d Segun Showunmi MEANWHILE, the Project Director, Jimi Adebisi Lawal Campaign Organisation, Mr. Austin Oniyokor,\u00a0has said the purported suspension of the just elected governorship candidate of Ogun PDP, Lawal, was nothing but the case of the voice of Jacob and the hand of Esau. In a statement he issued, Oniyokor said, \u201cTo be sure, it is a sad commentary on our democracy and the rule of law that some lawless individuals could gather somewhere under the remote control of one of the aspirants who has just been defeated in the court-ordered governorship rerun to claim to have suspended party stalwarts for complying with subsisting court orders and judgments. \u201cIt is the irony of our political space and system that those who are contemptuous of valid and subsisting judgments and orders of court could turn round to claim that they have suspended law-abiding citizens. \u201cClearly, this contemptuous act cannot stand the test of time and the law. All their contemptuous acts will be taken before the court and the full weight of the law will be visited on them in due course. \u201cUntil then, we want to appeal to all our party leaders, elders, supporters and the general public to remain firm in the face of the needless provocation. This political gymnastics will soon pass like others before it.\u201d But while talking to The Guardian, Lawal wondered how a party could have announced his suspension without following the necessary procedures in the party\u2019s Constitution. According to him, \u201cI wasn\u2019t issued a query or a disciplinary committee set up to investigate my matter and recommendations made for approval of necessary organs of the party. \u201cI also wondered why I should be suspended for obeying a court judgment if the NEC and the state executive were dragging their feet after the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum to conduct fresh primaries. In any case I am not the one they will suspend. All those who participated in other primaries across the local government and wards would also face similar action and let\u2019s see how that would be possible? Lawal said his name would be submitted to INEC as the governorship candidate of Ogun PDP by the state\u2019s financial secretary, who was part of the rerun primary. Reacting to the issues, Afolabi Orekoya, spokesman to Ladi Adebutu Governorship Campaign Organisation, said the rerun primary held by Lawal and his loyalists was a mere distraction that will never hold. He also dismissed the concern that Ogun PDP may not present a candidate for 2023 elections. \u201cSuch cannot happen because the Electoral Act 2022 is clear on the procedure. An appeal has been filed against the Federal High Court judgment and we are waiting for action. He also disclosed that his boss Adebutu now stands a better chance because one of the strong governorship aspirants has reconciled and crossed to our side. Immediate past state chairman of Ogun PDP, Prince Adebayo Dayo said the national headquarters should quickly intervene in the matter if PDP actually wants to win the state next year. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/ogun-state-pdp-in-another-round-of-crisis-over-rerun-primaries/"},

Wusono\u2019s statement reads in part that: \u201cIndeed, the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) has elected\u00a0spokesmen at state and national levels, including those at the Presidential Campaign Council, as well as the battery of media aides that its presidential candidate parades. \u201cHowever, giving the reputational damage that it may cause them, apart from possible litigation, the party chose an unsavory character to carry its dubious message, which is laden with injurious falsehoods. \u201cIn a statement that was widely published, Timi Frank claimed that Distinguished Senator Uba Sani and the Kaduna State Gubernatorial candidate of APC, sent thugs to disrupt PDP\u2019s presidential rally, without an iota of proof. Significantly, Timi Frank was mis-briefed by his paymasters.\u201d Wusono also pointed out that the Township Stadium venue of the PDP rally in Kaduna was half empty last Monday to the utter embarrassment of PDP chieftains, in a state that has a former vice president, an ex-governor and\u00a0a two-term senator, including former National Chairman of the party. On the same day, Wusono said Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate, was in Kaduna to interact with Northern Leaders at Arewa House.\u00a0 \u201cAll roads led to Arewa House as APC supporters, PDP die-hards and non partisan citizens of Kaduna State trooped to hear Tinubu\u2019s plans for the North when he becomes President of Nigeria by the Grace of God and the people\u2019s votes. \u201cConsequently, the PDP presidential rally was reduced to a Town Hall meeting and to cover this embarrassment, the party alleged that thugs attacked  their members at Ranchers Bees stadium,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, in a bid to set the records straight and clear his name, and\u00a0 APC\u2019s integrity, Timi Frank will hear from\u00a0 our lawyers in due course, if he does not retract that libelous statement and offer an unreserved apology to our Gubernatorial candidate and our party.\u201d \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/apc-denies-sponsoring-attack-on-atikus-rally-threatens-legal-action-against-timi-frank/"},

Unfortunately, when it comes to politics, women are pushed to the background and are only used to win votes and then cast aside when it comes to the spoils of politics. They are used and dumped until the next election cycle.  It\u2019s difficult to say the role they can play during the 2023 elections because all the different political parties are mostly fielding men for elective posts and all women do is hold large rallies that are sponsored by the male political bigwigs.  I really do not see any significant thing that will change in our body politics in the 2023 elections because the three major contenders \u2013 the Labour Party (LP), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) do not have any clear specific role for women. All they have are women leaders that mobilise other women to vote for these political bigwigs.  Women need to realise their power and go forward. They have the power of numbers and they can come together and mobilise to support other stronger women who can stand as presidential or governorship candidates in future election cycles. I honestly do not see this happening in 2023. \nAbsolutely not! Women are just a tool to win elections, and this is evident in the present ratio of women that are presidential and governorship candidates in Nigeria.  Even in the Senate, you can see the number of women\u2019s representation. It is sad that after 62 years as a nation we still do not see the need for full women\u2019s participation in politics.  Women in politics have been marginalised for too long and women need to sit down together and find a permanent solution to the problem. It seems an African problem that our men folk feel that the role of the woman is in the kitchen and the other room. There is always this feeling that they are doing women a favour by giving them the crumbs on the table when there should be at least a 60/40 ratio of participation in every political stratum of our nation. \nThey can influence the space to be relevant by coming together, banding together and organising themselves. Women and the youth of our nation from the biggest voting population so women can organise with the youth to form a formidable team that can make room for more youth and women participation in politics.  \nWomen have a chance and this is playing out globally with the leaders of the United Kingdom (UK), Netherlands and the Head of the European Union, to mention just a few. It will take time, and concerted effort and a well-thought-through plan.  I celebrate the work of the School of Politics, Policy and Governance (SPPG), with Alero Ayida-Otobo as the CEO. They are building a massive base and pipeline of a new and disruptive thinking political class. SPPG is an unconventional school designed to attract, develop and produce a new generation of political leaders who will listen and serve the new class of citizens who know their rights.  \nI believe very strongly that women bring a lot of value to the table wherever they find themselves. I also realised that it is tough for women to play the kind of politics that our male counterparts play in Nigeria, keeping late nights and so on. A lot of the rules of politics have to change and our male politicians have to find ways of accommodating the women who are genuinely interested in politics. Politics should not be a do-or-die affair. It should be practised with decency and decorum so that there can be more women participation going forward.  I believe that the next president should accommodate a 40 per cent participation of women in his administration.\u00a0Women are natural leaders because leadership is not about position but rather influence and if you cannot lead yourself then you have no business leading others.  \nWinning in any endeavour of life requires strategic thinking, planning, organising and execution. We need a crop of women who have that long-term view and are not in a hurry but purposefully carry through a plan of action that will put women in all strata of political life in Nigeria, possibly in the next 10 to15 years. The plan has to begin now. It has to be well thought out and properly executed. Nothing good comes easy so we must be prepared to work at it, and pray for it and then see it happen in our lifetime by the special grace of God Almighty.\u00a0", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/women-deserve-40-per-cent-appointment-in-next-administration/"},
{"headline": "Plateau LP torn by guber controversies, intrigues", "image_url": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/plugins/ventra-lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif", "author": "Leo Sobechi, Deputy Politics Editor, Abuja", "posted_date": "21 October 2022 \u00a0 | \u00a0\n                2:38 am", "description": "The 2023 political battle raging in Plateau State is akin to a sporadic melee on many fronts. Governor Simon Bako Lalong\u2019s insistence on giving his acolyte, Nentawe Yilwatda the governorship ticket of All Progressives Congress (APC) left a mass of dejected party faithful no option than to seek political vent elsewhere. Perhaps foreseeing the possibility of the governor foisting his preferred candidate on APC as its gubernatorial torchbearer, Ambassador Yohana Margif, who claims that his aspiration to be governor was backed up by divine revelations, moved over to the Labour Party (LP). As at the time of his entry, LP was still a sleepy political platform like other fringe parties in the league of the 18 recognised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). However, that near comatose characterisation was to change after June 24, 2022, when the former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Vice Presidential candidate in the 2019 poll joined to ventilate his 2023 presidential ambition. It could therefore be said that Peter Obi\u2019s entry to LP and the subsequent momentum his presidential run has generated became an albatross to Ambassador Margie. This is because after being displaced in APC, Dr Patrick Dakum, who like Ambassador Margif, is among former governor Joshua Dariye\u2019s enforcers during his tenure, joined LP. Both men are currently jostling for the court\u2019s attention for a declaration of who qualifies as the authentic governorship standard bearer of the Labour Party in Plateau State. While Ambassador Margif\u2019s supporters contend that Dariye was behind the attempt to smuggle Dr. Dakum onto the ballot as LP\u2019s gubernatorial contender, the former said that as a victim of political wickedness, he wants some respite. Intriguingly, Dariye, who alleged that his incarceration was politically motivated has not been visited by either the state chapter of APC or PDP, on which platforms he went to Senate and governed Plateau State. The former governor had, while appearing on a Channels Television programme, claimed that part of the money for which he was sent to prison was spent on campaigning for Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s second term election. Recall that in 2007, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) charged Dariye to court for misappropriating Plateau State\u2019s fund put at N1.126billion. But, insisting that it was a calculated attempt to blur his political clout, Senator Dariye explained that N800million out of that sum was credited to Plateau State account, adding that N100million went to Southwest PDP, while another N100million went to former President Obasanjo\u2019s campaign organisation. Giving a further breakdown, the former governor disclosed that a million went to the ecological fund, while N66 million went to PDP Plateau State, even as he described the outstanding balance of about an N4million as commission on turnover.\u201d Although the Court of Appeal, Abuja, reduced the sentence to 10 years, which the Supreme Court also affirmed, last April President Muhammadu Buhari, in the exercise of his prerogative of mercy announced his pardon on the grounds of age. \nHowever, while APC and PDP have maintained some silence and distance about the former governor\u2019s fate, parties to the LP governorship disputation associate him with the move to revise the outcome of the governorship primary, which threw up Ambassador Margif. Margif\u2019s supporters claim that the events leading to what they describe as illegal substitution of the governorship contender began with a joint visit by Senator Dariye and Dr Dakum to explore the possibilities of a voluntary withdrawal since according to them \u201cMargif does not possess the huge war chest to prosecute the governorship poll.\u201d In an interview with The Guardian, Ambassador Margif said he joined the LP, when the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Obi, was still in PDP, noting that at the time he emerged as the party\u2019s governorship candidate, Dr Dakum was also still in APC. It would be recalled that although Dr. Patrick Dakum announced his withdrawal from the Plateau State APC governorship primary when it became obvious that Governor Lalong\u2019s preferred aspirant was sure to clinch the ticket, he was credited with 70 votes from the straw poll. Dakum was among the 10 governorship aspirants that walked out of the primary, based on complaints that the venue was flooded with government appointees and unaccredited delegates. However, participating in a purported repeat LP primary after Ambassador Margif\u2019s alleged withdrawal, Dakum was said to have emerged as the party\u2019s gubernatorial contender.  But, alleging foul play, Margif contends that he neither withdrew his nomination nor did he write the LP chairman to announce that. He alleged that the letters purportedly written by him were outright forgeries, explaining that the two letters sent to INEC bore different dates of August 2 and 5. The embattled governorship candidate noted that on August 5 he was kept in a police cell, stressing that he rejected overtures to have him withdraw from the race to pave the way for Dr Dakum. State chairperson of the party, Mrs. Mary Zamfara, told The Guardian that the authentic governorship candidate of the party for Plateau State is Dr. Dakum, pointing out that that was the position of stakeholders and INEC. At any event, the LP national chairman, Mr Julius Abure, was said to have informed eminent stakeholders that, \u201canything that is not ceremonially done should be disregarded, it may be designed to play the purported candidate.\u201d  Margif maintains that until the court delivers its ruling on December 15, the claims of withdrawal or substitution remain a ruse, alleging many instances of forgeries, acts of intimidation and inducement in the attempt to deny him his mandate. He stated: \u201cAs it is today, we are in court, because of the illegal substitution, which they are claiming through letters of withdrawal. I was arrested on August 4 in Abuja and taken to Jos. \u201cIt was on that day, while I was in the cell that they claimed that I wrote a letter of withdrawal. I can\u2019t explain it; it is laughable. How can somebody be in a cell and he is writing a letter of withdrawal? \u201cIt is obvious that once you are so desperate, God will remove His hands from what you are doing so that you will use your hand to dig your own grave. They forged a document, I cannot even say it is my name, my name is Ambassador Yohana Yilpwan Margif, but they went and wrote Yohanna Yewan Marigif and that Yewan is not my father\u2019s name. \u201cThat apart, they forged a letter of withdrawal dated August 5, and submitted it to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). After some days again, they still went back to forge another letter again dated August 2. \n\u201cAnd that letter of August 2, is the one they attached with a court affidavit in their defence and all these two letters have been verified by my lawyer that they are all fake.\u201d As suspense defines the three-dimensional political battle in Plateau State, LP faithful in Plateau State argue that the big picture question begging for an answer is, does it mean that the internal affairs of the party are anchored on weak internal processes and undemocratic practices. It is yet to be seen whether the political wickedness, which Senator Dariye alleged as the cause of his incarceration is rearing its heads in LP, especially given that both Margif and Dariye are all from the same local government council. Could it be that an external force is instigating the storm in Plateau State LP, which has become the credible alternative to the governing APC and main opposition PDP? Already two conspiracy theories have been making the rounds about Ambassador Y.Y. Margif and the Plateau State LP 2023 governorship contestation. For instance, going by Mrs. Zamfara\u2019s declarations, there is the suggestion that Margif, who says he is the validly nominated LP governorship candidate from the June 9, 2022 primary, was aware of the party\u2019s decision to substitute him through the purported primary election of Dr. Patrick Dakum on August 5, 2022. How far this complies with the Electoral Act 2022 is yet to be seen, even as it comes off as a doubtful claim, particularly given Margif\u2019s denial of any formal or informal communication from LP with him about the party\u2019s decision to replace him. Margif contends that the case of voluntary withdrawal by a validly nominated candidate is one that is legally, morally and socially roused from dialogue and conversation between the lawful candidate and LP leadership. Such interface is essentially to nudge and persuade the candidate to consent to the exigency requiring the need for such substitution, but must not stem from arm-twisting or legal breaches. His supporters maintain that Margif was denied a fair hearing by LP leadership, alleging that the party leadership ignored the candidate, acted whimsically and resorted to daredevil traumatizing tactics, which subjected him (Margif) to threats, police arrests and detention, intimidation, harassment and blackmail to cajole him to relinquish the governorship ticket. As it stands Margif\u2019s decision to seek legal remedies through suit No. FHC/J/CS/76/2022 at the Federal High Court Jos, has put a dampener to LP\u2019s electioneering plans, thereby subjecting the party faithful to the suspense. What happens in the event that the court quashes the purported substitution? Could the parties to disagreement come together to prosecute the election as a united force? Although there are subdued claims that Margif\u2019s arrest and detention flows from serial criminality and chameleonic behaviours, stakeholders maintain that only a court of law could debar an aspirant from participating in election based on mere allegations not proved and upheld by a court of competent jurisdiction. Based on the foregoing, the validity of the purported meeting on August 3 and 4 during which the state and national chairpersons of LP hosted Ambassador Margif to persuade him to relinquish his ticket for his own safety and interest, does not confer legitimacy to the action taken without his consent. That INEC witnessed the August 9 governorship primary, which threw up Margif and subsequently issued him a certificate of return, suggests that he fulfilled all the requirements of the 2022 Electoral Act, as well as LP guidelines, upon which he was screened and cleared for the exercise. And, acting on providence, Amb Margif was said to have delivered a letter to LP headquarters and INEC on August 2, to debunk rumours that he had withdrawn from the governorship race. If the national leadership overlooked that letter and went ahead with the repeat primary, the party has opened itself to the probative decision of the court to ascertain the validity of Dr Dakum as its governorship primary. Only then could the party occupy its lane as the third horse for Plateau State governorship race.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/politics/plateau-lp-torn-by-guber-controversies-intrigues/"},

The ACE, however, said it was in this regard that the Authority decided to revive the forum to build on its past achievements, adding that the emergence of the forum was in response to heightened environmental consciousness and the global need for sustainable development in the industry. \u201cThe oil and gas industry has for several decades maintained pride of place at the top of the global energy mix despite the threat posed by renewable and cleaner energy sources. \u201cHowever, recent concerns about global warming, exponential improvements in the efficiency of renewable energy alternatives and the politics of oil pricing have combined to pose almost an existential threat to the global petroleum industry. \u201cThe threats of renewable energy sources which in the past were almost always dismissed by energy industry experts have today become more real than ever. \u201cAs we speak, some of the big International Oil Companies are funding gigantic research into alternative fuels. As sweet as Nigeria\u2019s crude is renowned to be globally, recently we lost our valued customers, and agas buyers are now competing with us in the same market space as suppliers. \u201cNigeria is to continue to benefit from its vast petroleum resources, now more than ever is the time to build sustainability into our oil and gas value chain as well as management of its wastes. \u201cAnd, this task rests on the shoulders of not only the Regulators but all stakeholders. It is thus fitting that the theme for this maiden edition of the HSE Managers forum for Mid and Downstream operators is: \u201cLet\u2019s BEGIN,\u201d he said. He urged the participants to come up with a communique that would reflect a collective commitment to sustainable development, with actionable ideas and recommendations for enhancing the HSE performance of the industry. In a remark, Captain John Tonlagha, Executive Commissioner, HSEC, Nigerian Upstream, Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) \nsaid the forum was tailored towards addressing the Midstream and Downstream operational and regulatory issues in the industry. He said the platform which was emplaced in the then Department of Petroleum Resources era had served as a veritable tool to bridge the gap between the regulator and the entirety of the value chain in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. \u201cHaving put the HSE Managers\u2019 forum into proper perspective based on its gains that we in the commission can attest to, I believe that the NMDPRA and all the players in this industry are on lasting partnership. \u201cThis will consolidate gains of the PIA and institutionalise key and laudable HSE-related programmes that will further help in the actualisation of our collective mandate,\u201d he said.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/pia-clearly-provides-for-safe-workplace-fg/"},

A statement by Mr Olajide Oshundun, Head, of Press and Public Relations in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, said that Sen Chris Ngige, the minister, said this on Thursday in Abuja. It said he spoke shortly after receiving an \u201cAward of Excellence,\u201d conferred on him by the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) at the 42nd Annual General Meeting/Scientific Conference of the association. The News Agency Nigeria (NAN) reports that the award was presented by the immediate past executive council of NARD. It would also be recalled that the new executive had, during a courtesy visit to Ngige, raised some concerns of the doctors. NARD had called for the review of the Consolidated Medical Salary Scale (CONMESS) wage structure. It also sought the correction of some \u201cminor errors\u201d in the circular on the upward review of the Medical Residency Training Fund (MRTF), and non-taxation of the call duty allowance and complained about the non-payment of the new hazard allowances to house officers. On the review of CONMESS, Ngige said that a committee had already been put in place at the Federal Ministry of Health, which was already working internally. \u201cIt (committee) will swing into action next week, to dialogue with the resident doctors and members of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU),\u2019\u2019 he said. He, therefore, said that there was no need for the doctors to issue a strike threat when the government had put a process in motion to address their concerns. \u201cThe Federal Government will no longer tolerate a strike that does not pass through due process. \u201cAny group that embarks on strike will be visited with Section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act (TDA), Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) 2004. \u201cIt says that when a worker goes on strike, especially those on essential services, the employer can also refuse to pay compensation or wages which accompany work done. \u201cThe due process of a strike is that social dialogue negotiation with employers should be explored first. \u201cIn the event of failure, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment office in the affected state or FCT should be notified and, finally, a Trade Dispute Notice (TDN) served,\u2019\u2019 he said. Ngige advised all aggrieved unions to emulate the doctors and commence proactive discussions with the Federal Government rather than resort to strike whenever issues arose. Reacting to the circular on the upward review of the Medical Residency Training Fund (MRTF), he assured the medics that the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission was working on it. He also added that the area of domiciliation of the fund for residents would be addressed during negotiation to align it with the National Residency Training Fund Act which is the guiding law, pointing out that a circular derives its life from extant laws. According to him, the issue of non-payment of new hazard allowance to house officers is being addressed by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation. \u201cThere was an inadvertent error in the submission of their list from the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN),\u2019\u2019 he noted. Ngige assured the workers that the house officers would get their money since they were captured in the payment. He, however, said the Federal Government could not stop the taxation of the call duty allowance of the doctors since it falls under the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), to be paid to the states under Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). He added that it was usually deducted by IPPIS on behalf of the state where a medical institution is located. Earlier, Dr Godiya Ishaya, the immediate past President of NARD, while presenting the award, commended the minister for the cooperation. Ishaya said that they enjoyed, cherished and appreciated the minister\u2019s open-door policy and appealed to him to extend the same to his successor. Speaking in a similar vein, the new President, Dr Emeka Orji, commended  Ngige for his efforts at restoring industrial harmony and peace. He said that the gesture was more felt in the health sector while urging the minister, as a medical elder of repute, to continue with his good works. The NARD delegation also commended  Ngige for the registration of the National Association of Medical and Dental Academics (NAMDA) as a trade union in the university system.

The support was declared by the house ad hoc Committee on Refineries after NNPCL intensified efforts to reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on the importation of petroleum products. Speaking during an oversight visit to the Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company (WRPC), the Chairman of the Committee, Rep. Abdul Ganiyu Johnson, said that they were ready and willing to work and support the NNPC towards realising the objective of the rehabilitation. Johnson said that the committee\u2019s visit was to ascertain the level of job that is ongoing in the refinery while expressing satisfaction that the contractor has already mobilised equipment and personnel to the site. The chairman gave the assurance that the committee would support any measure being taken by the NNPCL to ensure the commencement of production that would ultimately reduce dependence on fuel importation. Giving an overview of the plant, the acting Managing Director of the Company, Mr Desmond Inyamah, disclosed that a Quick \u2013fix Maintenance Service Contract for the refinery was signed in June and the timeline for the completion of Areas 1&2 is 12 months. Inyamah noted that the 12 months would begin to count from the commencement of work, adding that the refinery would operate at 60 per cent of its installed capacity after the completion of the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCC). He expressed delight at the show of solidarity and support by the legislators. It would be recalled that the quick fix maintenance service agreement for the Warri refinery was signed with Daewoo Nigeria limited on June 24 in Abuja. Refineries Rehab: Reps Back NNPCL, Declare Total Support In another development, the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSCHE) conferred the institution\u2019s Honorary Fellowship on the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of the NNPCL, Malam Mele Kyari. The conferment took place at the society\u2019s 30th Fellows\u2019 Conference in Abuja. Speaking at the ceremony, Prof. Ayodele Ogunye, a former president of the society, stated that the honour was in recognition of the valuable contributions of the Kyari-led NNPC towards the advancement of Chemical Engineering in Nigeria. Ogunye noted that the company remained the highest employer of chemical engineers in the country. Kyari, who was the Guest Speaker at the conference with the theme: New Perspectives for Addressing Upstream, Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Issues in Nigeria\u201d, disclosed that the new NNPC was open to a new business model of taking equity in viable projects against sole ownership. He said the major focus of the company was to ensure that the nation\u2019s refineries returned to optimal production capacity before presenting them to stakeholders to decide on the best way to manage the assets in the interest of all concerned. The NNPCL GCEO pointed out that the company while taking advantage of the opportunities provided by current assets to satisfy the energy needs of today, it looked forward to converting the plants into other useful purposes toward the 2060 net zero commitment. In his remarks, the conference chairman retired Maj.-Gen. IBM Haruna advised the leadership of the new NNPCL to take seriously the issue of good corporate governance based on transparency and accountability. This, Haruna said would enable the company to gain the confidence of the people, especially on matters of land and other operational assets. On his part, the President of the NSCHE and former Group Executive Director, the Gas and Power Directorate of the NNPC, Mr Seidu Mohammed, commended the NNPCL GCEO for the achievements recorded within the few years in office. He said that the body was ready to proffer workable solutions toward assisting the new NNPCL to achieve its desired goal, emphasising that the society had a pool of experienced professionals in that regard.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/nnpc-weekly-reps-declare-support-for-nnpcl-on-refineries-rehabilitation/"},

The National President of the Initiative, Lawal Sahabi in his speech read by the Bauchi State Chairman, Alkasim Abdulkadir said that: \u201cWe wish to use this opportunity to reply to suggestions making the rounds that Atiku Abubakar is behind recent moves by some elements of the Arewa Consultative Forum and Northern Elders Forum to endorse him as the single candidate of the region for the 2023 presidency. \u201cWe use the opportunity to ask the so-called elders to explain to northerners where they derived their mandate to impose a single candidate on the entire region.

Speaking at the presidential rally which took place at the Ranchers Bees Stadium in Kaduna, the Waziri Adamawa thanked the residents of Kaduna for giving him the highest number of votes back in the 2019 presidential election and vowed to take issues concerning Kaduna serious if the people vote en masse and ensure he wins the 2023 election. He said: \u201cLet me thank you for your support in 2019. You gave me the highest number of votes in 2019 and I believe you will do so this time around.

We will revive the industries in Kaduna in partnership with the private sector of Kaduna.\u201d Reacting earlier to reports of an attack on PDP members by suspected APC thugs at the rally, Mr Atiku urged President Buhari to call on all parties to call their supporters and members to order and to ensure that campaigns, just as with the elections themselves, are kept free, fair and safe. The former Nigerian vice president would later take to Twitter to voice his concern. \u201cI have just received emergency reports of attacks on PDP supporters by thugs sponsored to scuttle the ongoing PDP campaign rally in Kaduna State. This is undemocratic and against the Peace Accord all parties signed up for just a few weeks ago,\u201d he posted on his verified Twitter account. \u201cI urge President Muhammadu Buhari to call on all parties to call their supporters and members to order and to ensure that campaigns, just as with the elections themselves, are kept free, fair, and safe,\u201d Atiku stated. It is unclear if there are casualties from the attack as of the time of filing this report. The incident came hours after APC and PDP supporters clashed at a rally organised by the PDP in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital. The mayhem claimed the life of one person and left 18 others injured, according to the police. Back at the Ranchers Bees Stadium, the vice-presidential candidate of the party, Governor Ifeanyichukwu Okowa, said the people of southern Nigeria are ready to vote for the PDP and Atiku come 2023 following the success of the party in the recent gubernatorial election in Osun. \u201cI thank God for the life of Atiku who has a solution to the problem we have in Nigeria.

I\u2019m happy with what I have seen here and I thank you for your support, a happy Okowa said. In his remarks, the Director General of the Atiku\u2019s PPCO, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto state, said efforts to throw a spanner in the PDP\u2019s campaign will fail. \u201cThey do not want us to continue with our rallies because they are not prepared. They haven\u2019t constituted their campaign council and so, they want to drag us back but we are moving on with our campaign. \u201cThe people of Kaduna have seen and felt the negative impact of the APC and when Atiku gets into power by Next year, all the factories will return Insha Allah. \u201cHis administration will ensure we invigorate our economy to have jobs and better life. I urge the people of Kaduna to come out in their millions to vote come February 2023. The Party\u2019s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, in his remarks said\u00a0 despite being denied the prosed venue for the rally, the PDP has shown that if rallies were held on the road, they will always be successful. \u201cWhen they go low, we go high. they wanted to stop this rally, but they can\u2019t. Whether they give us the venue or not, we will do our rally on the road and win. APC has failed. They don\u2019t want us to recover this country and win.

The end for Truss came after a key minister resigned and many Tory MPs rebelled over an important vote in chaotic scenes at the House of Commons late Wednesday. By Thursday morning, more than a dozen Conservative MPs had publicly urged Truss to resign, after her tax-cutting plans caused a market meltdown during an already severe cost-of-living crisis. Many more were reported to have submitted letters to Brady calling for her to be removed, although party rules would have forbidden another leadership campaign for 12 months. \u201cThe prime minister acknowledges yesterday was a difficult day and she recognises the public wanted to see the government focusing less on politics and more on delivering their priorities,\u201d her official spokesman told reporters. Barely two hours later, she quit. Events reached a head after what right-wing tabloid The Sun called \u201ca day of extraordinary mayhem\u201d on Wednesday. Interior minister Suella Braverman left, apparently at Truss\u2019s demand after she sent a government document in a personal email. But Braverman, an arch right-winger who enjoys strong support among the Tory membership, used her resignation message to attack Truss in blistering terms. \nThere then followed farcical scenes in parliament as many Tory MPs rebelled against the government\u2019s demand that they drop the party\u2019s manifesto commitment to maintain a ban on fracking. Accusations swirled of heavy-handed efforts to whip MPs into line, some of whom later briefed the media that it was the nail in the coffin of the Truss premiership. Conservative lord Ed Vaizey said the \u201conly way out of this mess is for Liz Truss to stand down and for somebody to be appointed as prime minister by Conservative MPs\u201d. Now, the party can avoid a lengthy leadership contest by consolidating around a unity candidate for her replacement. Truss beat former finance minister Rishi Sunak in the leadership race after Boris Johnson announced his resignation in July \u2014 but Johnson supporters have vowed to block a coronation for Sunak now. \nThe prime minister\u2019s woes began when her showpiece tax-slashing policy sparked market chaos that threatened the country\u2019s pension funds, forcing her into a series of humiliating U-turns. Braverman\u2019s departure on Wednesday triggered the second reshuffle this month after Truss sacked close ally Kwasi Kwarteng over the budget debacle, replacing him with Jeremy Hunt, who swiftly reversed almost all the policy announcements. The Daily Telegraph reported that Braverman left after a \u201cheated face-to-face row\u201d with Truss and Hunt \u201cover their demands to soften her stance on immigration\u201d. Truss appointed Grant Shapps to replace Braverman despite firing him as transport secretary when she took office. Both Shapps and Hunt had supported her rival for leadership, Sunak, leaving her isolated in her own cabinet. Braverman, seen as a hardliner on immigration, said she had resigned over a \u201ctechnical infringement\u201d of government rules. But in her resignation letter, she flagged up \u201cserious concerns\u201d that Truss was breaking manifesto promises. \u201cPretending we haven\u2019t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can\u2019t see we\u2019ve made them, and hoping things will magically come right is not serious politics,\u201d Braverman wrote. \nBraverman\u2019s resignation message came hours after Truss sought to dispel doubts over her leadership with a combative appearance in parliament. Truss faced harsh putdowns from Labour\u2019s Starmer as she took part in her first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions since the budget U-turns. Starmer asked the House of Commons: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a prime minister whose promises don\u2019t even last a week?\u201d, as opposition MPs jeered and booed Truss, and her own party\u2019s MPs remained silent.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/world/uk-pm-resigns-successor-to-be-elected-next-week/"},

Writing for 90min.com, Tom Gott and Graeme Bailey said Chelsea is exploring signing a new striker next summer, with Osimhen emerging as a favourite among scouts. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was brought in from Barcelona late in the summer transfer window, and while his return of three goals from six games is more than respectable, there is an acceptance that the 33-year-old will not be Chelsea\u2019s long-term striker. The Blues do have Romelu Lukaku on the books, but the duo quote sources as confirming that Chelsea and manager Graham Potter are not planning to reintegrate the Belgian into the squad after his loan from Inter comes to an end and will instead try to offload him permanently. In his place, Chelsea hopes to make a significant splash on a new striker and scouts have been sent around the world to draw up a list of potential options, and there have been glowing reports of 23-year-old Osimhen, who has been of interest to the Blues in the past. The Nigeria international has four goals in eight games this season, maintaining the electric form that saw him finish the 2021/22 Serie A campaign with 14 goals in 27 outings. Under contract until 2025, Osimhen has been highlighted as a possible target but Chelsea is by no means alone, with Bayern Munich is known to be a fan of the Nigeria international. With competition for Osimhen\u2019s signature expected to be fierce, Chelsea is considering multiple options and another who has impressed scouts is Lille\u2019s Jonathan David. The Canada international took Osimhen\u2019s place in the Lille setup in 2020 and has nine goals in 11 Ligue 1 games this year. Chelsea is also understood to hold an interest in Juventus\u2019 Dusan Vlahovic and would consider a move for the Serb if he hit the market, but that is not expected to happen. 90min understands neither Vlahovic nor Juventus have any desire to force an exit. As well as a new striker, Chelsea continues to pursue a double deal for RB Leipzig duo Christopher Nkunku and Josko Gvardiol, while West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice has been made the Blues\u2019 top midfield target. Brighton\u2019s Leandro Trossard is also of interest to former Seagulls boss Potter, but he has been offered a club-record contract to commit his future to the team. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "sports", "url": "https://guardian.ng/sport/chelsea-turn-to-osimhen-as-search-for-reliable-striker-continues/"},

An initiative of Jennifer Okoye, a seasoned sports reporter in collaboration with Plateau State Contributory Health Care Management Agency (Plaschema), the first Road Waka was done in 2018 as an appreciation event for the listeners and fans of Jayfm, who stood behind the station when it was shut down by NBC. Okoye said De Amazone Roadwaka is an event designed to orient the public on the need and importance of healthy living through physical and mental health exercise. She added: \u201cDe Amazone RoadWaka is geared towards curbing the high rate of obesity, health complications and unhealthy living in our society, which can lead to various sicknesses and early death. \u201cIt is a road show that will consist of different fitness routines (10km walk, aerobics) to help enlighten, educate and engage participants to imbibe the culture of physical and mental fitness.\u2019\u2019 But the race seems to have grown beyond the vision of the initiator, as the 2022 edition will be graced by elite runners and managers. Steve Nuhu, one of the most successful elite marathon managers and coaches in Nigeria, is leading a team of elite runners that includes Adamu Muazu, Emmanuel Gyan, Deborah Pam and others to the walk. Reacting to the expected participation of elite runners in the 2022 edition, Okoye said her dream is to take the RoadWaka to the next level in 2023 by organizing a bigger race, probably a half marathon or even a full marathon. \u201cWhy not a full marathon? This event started as a 5km Waka now it\u2019s 10km Waka our next level is a marathon. Don\u2019t forget Plateau and its environs are the home of the best marathon runners in Nigeria, a marathon race in Plateau, followed by an elite development programme will impact our youths positively\u2019\u2019. Okoye thanks Plateau State Contributory Health Care Management Agency, Jay 101.9 FM Jos, Magxi-Taste Sharwama, NASCO, Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, FRSC and other corporate organizations and individuals who do not want their name mentioned in the media that contributed to the huge success of the 2022 edition of the race. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "sports", "url": "https://guardian.ng/sport/jos-agog-for-de-amazone-10-km-roadwaka-tomorrow/"},

Post-match talk following the impressive 2-0 victory over Spurs at Old Trafford on Wednesday has been dominated by the early exit of the 37-year-old Portuguese superstar. Ronaldo headed down the tunnel before the final whistle and made a hasty departure from Old Trafford. United announced on Thursday that the forward had been dropped from the squad for Saturday\u2019s clash with Chelsea following his tantrum. Asked at his pre-match press conference whether Ronaldo had refused to come on a substitute against Spurs, Ten Hag said: \u201cYes.\u201d Ten Hag said: \u201cWhat (happened in) the talk is between Cristiano and me. The (club) statement is also clear, I think.\u201d But the Dutch manager, in his first season at Old Trafford, said Ronaldo \u201cremains an important part of the squad.\u201d The forward was also among those that left Old Trafford early in July\u2019s pre-season friendly against Rayo Vallecano, leading Ten Hag to underline the importance of players staying to support their team-mates. Asked how he deals with the situation, the Dutchman said on Friday: \u201cHow we did. I am the manager. I am responsible for the top sport culture here and I have to set standards and values and I have to control them. \u201cWe are in a team, so we have standards, we have values and I have to control that. After Rayo Vallecano, I told (you) it was unacceptable but he wasn\u2019t the only one. That is for everyone. \u201cWhen it\u2019s the second time, that will have consequences. That is what we did. We miss him tomorrow. That is a miss for us. For the squad it\u2019s a miss. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important for the attitude and mentality from the group. Now we have to focus on Chelsea and that is the most important.\u201d \u2013 Heat of the moment \u2013 \nRonaldo responded to his omission from the squad by saying he had acted in the heat of the moment. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to set the example myself for the youngsters that grew in all the teams that I\u2019ve represented,\u201d he posted on Instagram on Thursday. \u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s not always possible and sometimes the heat of the moment gets the best of us. \u201cRight now, I just feel that I have to keep working hard in Carrington, support my teammates and be ready for everything in any given game. \u201cGiving in to the pressure is not an option. It never was. This is Manchester United, and united we must stand. Soon we\u2019ll be together again.\u201d The former Real Madrid and Juventus star scored 24 goals in all competitions in 2021/22 in his first season back at Old Trafford, where he made his name as a global star. But, disappointed by United\u2019s failure to qualify for the Champions League, he has tried and failed to engineer a move away from Old Trafford. Ronaldo, a five-time Champions League winner with Real and United, has started only two Premier League games this season and has just one goal to his name in the English top flight. The forward, who missed United\u2019s pre-season tour to Australia and Thailand for \u201cfamily reasons\u201d, also reacted badly when he was substituted by Ten Hag in last week\u2019s draw against Newcastle.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "sports", "url": "https://guardian.ng/sport/ronaldo-refused-to-come-on-as-sub-says-man-utd-boss-ten-hag/"},

Minutes later he was sacked in a severe blow to his managerial reputation. The former Rangers boss paid the price for just two wins in the first 11 Premier League matches of the season, with only goal difference keeping Villa out of the relegation zone after the 3-0 loss to Fulham on Thursday. The former Liverpool and England midfield great, who replaced Dean Smith at Villa last November, was tipped as a potential long-term successor to current Reds boss Jurgen Klopp following his successful spell in Scotland. Now Gerrard must bide his time as he waits for an opportunity to rehabilitate a reputation tarnished by his 11-month spell at Villa Park. The 42-year-old struck a defiant tone after his team slumped again, saying he would \u201cnever, ever quit anything whether it\u2019s football or in life\u201d but the guillotine fell moments later, signalling a rare failure in a stellar career in football. Considered one of the greatest players in Premier League history, Gerrard made a promising start to life as a manager, guiding Rangers to their first Scottish Premiership title for a decade in 2021. The achievement won him hero status among the Rangers fans as it denied bitter rivals Celtic a record 10th straight league title. But Gerrard has been unable to build on that impressive work since moving to Villa Park, as a series of lacklustre performances have prevented him from winning over the club\u2019s supporters. He won just 13 of his 40 games in charge of the former European champions, losing 19 of those. When he joined the club they were 16th in the Premier League table. He led them to a 14th-place finish last season but leaves with Villa 17th in the table, level on points with Wolves, who are in the bottom three. Despite being given significant transfer backing, including a swoop for Barcelona\u2019s Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho, Gerrard was unable to deliver the \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d that Villa chief executive Christian Purslow demanded. He has also been hampered by injuries to Diego Carlos, Boubacar Kamara and Lucas Digne, all of whom signed during his tenure. Coutinho \u2014 brought in on a permanent deal from Barcelona after a loan spell last season \u2014  has been a major disappointment. Gerrard, who played with the Brazilian at Liverpool, said the player would \u201cgo up another level\u201d after signing a four-year deal but Coutinho has yet to score this season and looks a shadow of the footballer whom Barcelona paid \u00a3142 million ($158 million) for in 2018. \nGerrard\u2019s former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher said Gerrard\u2019s experience at Villa was a harsh lesson in how difficult the transition into a coaching career can prove, no matter your credentials as a player. \u201cWhen you go into management, you know the price on the ticket \u2014 and if results are not right or whether the players are letting you down or not performing, it is the manager that carries the can,\u201d he told Sky Sports News. \u201cThat is always the case and that is the brutal part of football management.\u201d Villa, owned by billionaires Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, are reportedly prepared to pay one of the highest salaries in the Premier League to land a top replacement for Gerrard. Former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with the post, along with ex-Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel. Whether either of the two men could be persuaded to join a club in Villa\u2019s perilous position remains to be seen. Other contenders could include Villarreal coach Unai Emery, who has Premier League experience with Arsenal, and former Burnley boss Sean Dyche, a veteran of numerous relegation battles with the Clarets.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "sports", "url": "https://guardian.ng/sport/gerrards-reputation-takes-a-hit-after-aston-villa-sacking/"},

This is my view and the view of a lot of my colleagues and citizens. \u201dGiving the age of our democracy, policing at the community level is not only desirable, but it is also important and it is what should be done and what we require. \u201dWe will continue to advocate for State Police. We have said that State Police is not in any form to retrench or reduce whatever the Nigerian Police is doing now. \u201dThere would still be clear responsibility that would be federal in nature; they would still have direct responsibility and oversight to continue to address. \u201dWe also know that if you look at the ratio of policemen to our huge population, we are still far from what it should be. \u201dSo, for us, it is really another level of employment generation; providing what we are sworn to do, which is the protection of life and property; ensuring there is peace and tranquillity within our state,\u201d he said. The governor said the move was constitutional and has been pushed at various stakeholders\u2019 levels. \u201dThe population is growing on a daily basis and we need to be proactive to be able to respond and be able to ensure that we don\u2019t have space for criminal-minded people or people that have other intentions within our own territory,\u201d he said. Sanwo-Olu, who commended the work of the Lagos Police Command led by the State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, said his administration would continue to encourage the Police to do what was right at all times. Speaking earlier, Justice Ogunbiyi commended Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s administration on the issue of security, as security remained top-notch in Lagos State. She called on other states in the country to emulate Lagos\u2019 security situation, which he said was top-notch, as \u201dLagos is a model of how to handle security situations\u201d. \u201dThe Police are doing a good job in Lagos and they could also replicate in all other states and parts of the country. \u201cThis is basically why we are here, to appreciate the governor and that he should continue with the good work,\u201d Ogunbiyi said. She said that the Police Service Commission would ensure that the Nigeria Police worked within the ambit of the law and ensure that they were well looked after.

Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer reiterated his view that Johnson was \u201cunfit\u201d to govern. \u201cSo if they\u2019re going to go from this experiment, this chaos, this economic damage, and wind back three months to a man who was deemed to be unfit for office, I think that only adds insult to injury for the public,\u201d he told the BBC. But any lingering Johnsonian ambitions will run into the high bar set by the Conservative party for leadership candidates this time \u2014 at least 100 nominations each from among Tory MPs. \u201cI don\u2019t think that MPs will want to go back and pick the same person they drummed out of Downing Street only a few months ago,\u201d Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, told AFP. \u201cTwo-thirds of voters wanted him to resign. It\u2019s fantasy land to think that voters want him back,\u201d he added. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/johnson-comeback-bid-adds-drama-to-uk-political-soap-opera/"},
{"headline": "At least 150 killed in two days of fighting in Sudan\u2019s south", "image_url": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/plugins/ventra-lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif", "author": "AFP", "posted_date": "20 October 2022 \u00a0 | \u00a0\n                8:40 pm", "description": "At least 150 people including children have been killed in two days of fighting in the latest ethnic clashes over land disputes in Sudan\u2019s southern Blue Nile state, a medic said Thursday. The fighting is some of the worst in recent months, and crowds took to the streets of the Blue Nile state capital Damazin in protest, chanting slogans condemning a conflict that has left hundreds dead this year. Clashes in Blue Nile broke out last week after reported arguments over land between members of the Hausa people and rival groups, with residents reporting hundreds fleeing intense gunfire and homes set ablaze. The fighting has centred around the Wad al-Mahi area near Roseires, some 500 kilometres (310 miles) south of the capital Khartoum. \u201cA total 150 people including women, children and elderly were killed between Wednesday and Thursday,\u201d said Abbas Moussa, head of Wad al-Mahi hospital. \u201cAround 86 people were also wounded in the violence.\u201d On Thursday, hundreds marched through Damazin, some calling for the state governor to be sacked, witnesses said. \u201cNo, no to violence,\u201d the demonstrators chanted. Eddie Rowe, the United Nations aid chief for Sudan, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d at ongoing fighting, reporting that \u201can unconfirmed 170 people have been killed and 327 have been injured\u201d since the latest unrest began on October 13. \u2013  \u2013 \nThe UN mission in Sudan said it was \u201calarmed\u201d by the \u201cresurgence of conflict\u201d in Blue Nile, a region awash with guns bordering South Sudan and Ethiopia, that is still struggling to rebuild after decades of civil war. Last week, clashes in the same area of Blue Nile sparked by \u201ca dispute over land issues\u201d left at least 13 people dead and 24 injured, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Authorities imposed an overnight curfew in a bid to contain the violence. Sudan is grappling with deepening political unrest and a spiralling economic crisis since last year\u2019s military coup, led by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The military power grab upended a transition to civilian rule launched after the 2019 ouster of strongman Omar al-Bashir, who ruled for three decades. \u201cSustainable peace won\u2019t be possible without a fully functional credible government that prioritises local communities\u2019 needs including security, and addresses the root causes of conflict\u201d, the UN added. A surge in ethnic violence in recent months has highlighted the security breakdown in Sudan since the coup. More than 546 people were killed and more than 211,000 forced to flee their homes in inter-communal conflicts across the country from January to September, according to the UN. \u2013 \u2013 \nFighting between the Hausa people and other groups first broke out in July, with some 149 people recorded as dead and 124 wounded up until early October, according to a toll reported by OCHA. The July clashes erupted after Hausa members requested the creation of a \u201ccivil authority\u201d, that rival groups saw as a means of gaining access to land. The clashes also triggered angry protests across Sudan, with the Hausa people demanding justice for those killed. By late July, senior leaders agreed to cease hostilities. Clashes broke out again in September. In a separate conflict, violence broke out earlier this week around Lagawa in West Kordofan between the Nuba and Arab Misseriya groups, also in the south of Sudan, some 580 kilometres (360 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission reported 19 dead and 34 injured in that conflict, according to the UN, with 36,500 people fleeing the violence. The army accused a holdout rebel group of shelling Lagawa on Tuesday, wounding two members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/at-least-150-killed-in-two-days-of-fighting-in-sudans-south/"},

The decision is the latest twist in political wrangling that began even before Khan\u2019s April ouster and is one of several legal battles being fought by the former international cricket star and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Dozens of his supporters attacked vehicles as they left the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) headquarters after the ruling, and police detained one of Khan\u2019s security guards after he fired a shot into the ground. In the eastern city of Lahore, his supporters blocked some roads, while in Faisalabad, they used burning tyres to stop traffic. On Twitter, Islamabad police said security in the capital was on \u201chigh alert\u201d. \u201cThe ECP has declared Imran Khan was involved in corrupt practices,\u201d Gohar Khan, one of his lawyers, told AFP, adding he had been disqualified for five years. \u201cWe are going to challenge it in the Islamabad High Court right now.\u201d Pakistan\u2019s courts are often used to tie up lawmakers in lengthy proceedings that rights monitors criticise for stifling political opposition, but the commission\u2019s involvement, in this case, stems from the obligation of elected officials to declare all their assets. The case centres on a government department known as \u201cToshakhana\u201d, which during the Mughal era referred to the \u201ctreasure houses\u201d kept by the subcontinent\u2019s princely rulers to store and display gifts lavished on them. Government officials must declare all gifts but are allowed to keep those below a certain value. More expensive items must go to Toshakhana, but in some cases, the recipient can buy them at around 50 percent of their value \u2014 a discount Khan raised from 20 percent while in office. Pakistani newspapers have for months carried lurid stories alleging Khan and his wife received lavish gifts worth millions during trips abroad \u2014 including luxury watches, jewellery, designer handbags and perfumes. Khan has said he did not register some gifts on national security grounds, but in a written submission admitted buying items worth nearly 22 million rupees ($100,000), and later selling them for more than twice that amount. \nUnless overturned by the courts, Khan\u2019s ban will stymie one of his key tactics to disrupt the country\u2019s political process as he presses for a general election ahead of the one scheduled for October next year. All PTI lawmakers have quit the National Assembly \u2014 parliament\u2019s lower house \u2014 forcing a series of by-elections. In most of them so far, Khan has been his party\u2019s only candidate. This week he won six of eight National Assembly seats he stood for in a weekend by-election, a vote he called a referendum on his popularity. Individuals can stand in multiple constituencies in Pakistani elections and choose which to forfeit if they win more than one. Khan regularly holds rallies drawing tens of thousands of people across the country, giving fiery speeches criticising state institutions \u2014 including the powerful military \u2014 for allegedly conspiring to topple his government. He has also vowed to soon announce the date of a \u201clong march\u201d of his supporters on the capital. \nKhan rode to power in 2018 on a populist platform promising social reforms, religious conservatism and a fight against corruption, overturning decades of rule by two feuding political dynasties interspersed with military takeovers. But under his tenure, the economy stagnated and he lost the support of the army, which was accused of helping to get him elected. Khan\u2019s opponents were delighted by the Election Commission\u2019s ruling. \u201cHe who would spread lies about the alleged corruption of his political opponents has been caught red-handed,\u201d tweeted Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Legal experts and analysts were more circumspect, however. \u201cThe silver lining for Mr Khan is that\u2026 he hasn\u2019t been disqualified by the apex court so he has a right of appeal,\u201d independent lawyer Osama Malik told AFP. \u201cThis decision will escalate the political tension in the country and the situation will deteriorate,\u201d said analyst Hassan Askari Rizvi.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/former-pakistan-pm-khan-barred-from-elections-for-five-years/"},

Parliament speaker Nabih Berri called for another vote on Monday in the hope of overcoming long-running discord between political factions in crisis-hit Lebanon, already governed by a caretaker cabinet. Lawmaker Michel Moawad, son of former president Rene Moawad, emerged as a frontrunner when parliament first convened to vote on a new president last month, with lawmakers opposed to the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement backing his candidacy. But the 42 votes he received in Thursday\u2019s session fell well short of the 65 needed for election in the second round of voting. A total of 119 lawmakers from Lebanon\u2019s 128-seat parliament attended the session, but quorum was lost before a second round could be held after some lawmakers walked out. Fifty-five lawmakers cast blank ballots. \u201cWe are still working on uniting the ranks of the opposition,\u201d lawmaker Samy Gemayel, who has backed Moawad\u2019s candidacy, told reporters after the session. \u201cWe are facing difficulties, but I hope that as the October 31 deadline approaches everyone will join forces.\u201d Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah told reporters before the vote that \u201cthere is no consensus and no comprehensive dialogue between the different blocs.\u201d Under Lebanon\u2019s longstanding confessional power-sharing system, the presidency is reserved for a Maronite Christian. Aoun was elected in 2016 after a more than two-year vacancy at the presidential palace as lawmakers made 45 failed attempts to reach a consensus on a candidate. The political deadlock has also scuppered efforts to form a new government since the outgoing cabinet\u2019s mandate expired in May, despite the country being gripped by its worst-ever financial crisis. At the end of a short visit to Beirut last week, France\u2019s Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna urged the swift election of a new president to avoid further political turmoil. \u201cLebanon today cannot risk a power vacuum,\u201d she said. Since 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost more than 95 percent of its value against the dollar on the black market and poverty rates have climbed to cover most of the population.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/lebanon-fails-for-third-time-to-elect-president/"},

Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in the capital N\u2019Djamena to mark the date when the military had initially promised to hand over power \u2014 a spell that has been extended for another two years. \u201cThere were about 30 deaths, including about 10 among the security forces, and several injured,\u201d government spokesman Aziz Mahamat Saleh told AFP. \u201cA banned demonstration became an insurrection,\u201d he said. He accused demonstrators of attacking \u201cpublic buildings\u201d, including the offices of the governor, the headquarters of the prime minister\u2019s party and that of the speaker of parliament. An AFP reporter saw five bodies on the floor of the city\u2019s Union Chagoua Hospital, two of which were covered with the Chadian national flag and three with bloodied white sheets. The head doctor, Joseph Ampil, later confirmed to AFP that five individuals had \u201cdied from gunshots\u201d. Palls of black smoke could be seen in some parts of the city and the crack of teargas grenades could be heard. Barricades were set up in several districts and tyres were set alight in the main avenues to block traffic. In an opposition stronghold, streets were deserted and littered with tree branches and piles of bricks. Schools and university establishments were closed, and many traders in the city centre lowered their shutters. The headquarters of Prime Minister Saleh Kebzabo\u2019s UNDR party was also attacked by demonstrators \u201cand partially burned down\u201d, UNDR Vice President Celestin Topona told AFP. France, Chad\u2019s former colonial power, condemned the violence, noting it featured \u201cthe use of lethal weapons against demonstrators\u201d. \u201cFrance is not playing any part in these events, which lie strictly in Chad\u2019s domestic political domain,\u201d the foreign ministry said. \u201cFalse information about France\u2019s purported involvement is baseless.\u201d Moussa Faki Mahamat, head of the African Union Commission, posted a tweet to \u201cfirmly condemn the repression\u201d of the protests and call for peaceful ways to overcome the country\u2019s \u201ccrisis\u201d. \nThe violence comes on the heels of a national forum organised by military strongman Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno that extended his stay in power. The 38-year-old five-star general took over in April 2021 after his iron-fisted father, Idriss Deby Itno, in power for three decades, was killed during an operation against rebels. The younger Deby has since angered many at home and embarrassed backers abroad by staying in power beyond his initially promised deadline, which would have expired on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re firing on us. They are killing our people,\u201d Succes Masra, whose Transformers party was among groups that had called the protest, said on Twitter. \u201cThe Soldiers of the one-and-only General who refused to honour his word and on the day when the 18 months are up \u2014 this is how he intends to install the (Deby) dynasty.\u201d Deby\u2019s junta had originally declared it would restore civilian rule after 18 months in power and he initially promised not to take part in elections that would follow. But as this deadline neared, a nationwide forum staged by Deby reset the clock. On October 1, the conference approved a new \u201cmaximum\u201d 24-month timeframe for holding elections. It also named Deby \u201ctransitional president\u201d and declared he could be a candidate in the poll. Deby was sworn in on October 10, and later appointed a so-called government of national union headed by Kebzabo, a 75-year-old former journalist and one-time opposition figure. One protester, Abass Mahamat, 35, said he had chosen to voice his anger at \u201cthis facade of a dialogue which entrenches the system\u201d. \u201cIn 31 years, we haven\u2019t seen any positive change in our country.\u201d The vast, arid Sahel state has had a long history of coups and political turmoil since it gained independence from France in 1960. During his long stay in power, the elder Deby fought off several attempts to unseat him by rebels crossing from Libya and Sudan. He was supported by France, which deemed him a strong ally in its campaign against jihadism in the Sahel.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/chad-protest-clashes-leave-about-30-dead-including-security-forces/"},

The event was part of his visitation to the state in his ongoing nationwide youth mobilisation and energising tour, which began in the Northeast region of the country. The trainees, in a statement signed by his Media Assistant, Esther Oyeyinka, were drawn from the 27 councils in Jigawa State under the state\u2019s implementation of the Progressive Young Leaders Summit, an effort led by Ahmed Muhammed Guma, the leader of the Tinubu/ MUD Support Organisation, in partnership with the Office of the National Youth Leader. Guma is domesticating the youth empowerment initiative of the National Youth Leader, having served on the organising committee of the party\u2019s novel, Progressive Young Leaders Summit, organised by Dayo Israel in Abuja last month. Beneficiaries received training in various vocational skills, including catering, arts and crafts, and ICT. The multiphase training will last a couple of months.  Speaking at the event, Israel emphasised the importance of a skilled workforce to the nation, noting that the APC administration, including the one Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will lead if elected in 2023, is about employment and wealth creation. He said, \u201cour party appreciates the importance of providing our youths, women, and other citizens with the requisite skills and support they need to attain self-reliance and inspire economic growth. We are about capacity building, job creation, and prosperity.\u201d This training is a testament to that and the country can expect more if the APC is supported to retain power next year.\u201d Earlier, he was at the Jigawa State Secretariat where he hosted a Town Hall Meeting with youth leaders and stakeholders of the party in the state. Present at the interactive session was Abubakar Sadiq Jallo, a member of the Jigawa State House of Assembly; Bala Usmab Chamo, the Dutse LG Chairman; Naijb Falalu Gantsa, SA on Urban Renewal; Hamza Mohammed, SA on Community Inclusion; Salisu Babura, SA Youth; members of support groups and the local leaders of the party.  Sharing his agenda for 2023 with the local youth leaders, Israel charged them to \u201cdo all they can to ensure a total victory for the APC in all the elective positions up for contest in 2023.\u201d Meanwhile, Israel has commended Jigawa State Governor, Badaru Abubakar, for his outstanding performance in the state, describing him as an outstanding administrator and silent achiever. Israel, who said this during a tour of some key projects of the Badaru administration in Jigawa State, where he is making an official visit as part of his ongoing nationwide youth mobilisation and energising tour, noted that the giant strides justify his appointment as the northern coordinator of the party\u2019s Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) and will ease his efforts toward securing the region for the party at the polls in 2023. The National Youth Leader, according to a statement by Oyeyinka, was also at the GCC Granite Processing Company, a world-class model secondary school and other project sites across the state, where, according to him, the \u201ctransformative touch of Governor Badaru Abubakar was evident and positively impacting the lives of the people.\u201d     Offering a remark during a meeting with the Deputy Governor and APC governorship candidate of the State, Malam Umar Namadi, and the national youth leader lauded the \u2018silent achievements\u2019 of the administration, including its \u2018exemplary\u2019 inclusion of young people, which he said has placed the state on a \u2018stable path of sustainable growth and development.\u2019 In continuation of his tour of Northern states, Israel was in Katsina state, where he condoled families affected by bandits\u2019 attacks in Batagarawa Local Government Area where he donated food and other relief materials to them. Israel who visited the grieving families alongside Dr Rikko Radda, the APC governorship candidate in Katsina State, and other youth stakeholders expressed sadness over the incident and offered assurances on the commitment of the state and Federal Government to secure the release of all abducted members of the communities and put a final stop to insecurity in the country. The youth leader in a release signed by his Media Assistant, Esther Oyeyinka, said, \u201cThe attack was disheartening and we grieve with you. Please know that you are not alone. \u201cThe state and Federal Government know your plight and I have obtained assurances that efforts are presently ongoing to secure the release of your relatives and neighbors who were sadly abducted, as well as to find a final solution to the insecurity challenge. \u201cEveryone here present has had to grapple with the emotional and physical pain of the absence of precious family members and breadwinners. Nothing short of a return will end this pain and we, as a party, will see to it that it is done. \u201cBut in the meantime, I am donating food and other relief materials to all of you to alleviate this great pain even as I continue engagements with all relevant agencies over the quick rescue of your loved ones,\u201d Isreal said.

Bolstered by China\u2019s economic and military rise over the past decade, Xi \u2014 who is expected to secure a norm-breaking third term after this week\u2019s Communist Party Congress \u2014 has swerved decisively away from the \u201ckeep a low profile\u201d foreign policy mantra espoused by his predecessors. Over the last 10 years, as well as encouraging a brand of headline-grabbing \u201cWolf Warrior\u201d diplomacy, Beijing has created alternative trade and security blocs to Western-led groupings, and courted support within organisations such as the UN through cheque-book diplomacy. \u201cWhen I went back to China in 2012, it was clear that Chinese diplomats had been given new marching orders by Xi Jinping,\u201d Guy Saint-Jacques, who was posted to Beijing in the mid-80s and mid-90s before serving as Canada\u2019s ambassador until 2016, told AFP. \u201cIt became gradually more difficult to raise difficult issues with Chinese diplomats, especially on issues related to the treatment of minorities\u2026 freedom of expression and so on.\u201d China\u2019s foreign policy is devised by elite groups within the Communist Party \u2014 groups that \u201cunlike his predecessors, Xi directly controls\u201d, said Jennifer Hsu from the Australian think tank Lowy Institute. Xi has chastised moderates in the foreign ministry for lacking \u201ca fighting spirit\u201d and books on his ideology are now mandatory reading for diplomats. On Thursday, at a press conference on Chinese diplomacy during the Congress, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu signalled Beijing would not be changing tack. \u201cDaring to fight and being good at fighting are the fine traditions and distinctive features of China\u2019s diplomacy,\u201d Ma told reporters. \nUnder Xi, China has taken a distinctly more muscular approach when it comes to territorial claims. It has ramped up its military presence in contested areas of the South China Sea, while a longstanding border dispute with India erupted into violence that left at least 24 dead in June 2020. \u201cChina\u2019s territorial expansionism has coincided with the ascension of Xi,\u201d James Char from Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies told AFP. All this has been cheered on by \u201cWolf Warrior\u201d diplomats \u2014 the name coined after a nationalist action film. Using notably undiplomatic language, high-ranking representatives have attacked both leaders \u2014 such as dismissing Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau as a \u201cboy\u201d \u2014 and individuals, like when the Chinese ambassador to France blasted a researcher as a \u201clittle thug\u201d for commenting on parliamentarians visiting Taiwan. On Sunday, footage of a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester being assaulted on the grounds of the Chinese consulate in the British city of Manchester sparked outrage, with the consul-general himself caught up in the fracas. Zheng Xiyuan told Sky News that getting physically involved was \u201cmy duty\u201d, adding that any diplomat would have acted that way to \u201cmaintain our dignity\u201d. But while such verbal and physical skirmishes are eye-catching, observers suggest their main aim may be to satisfy nationalists at home rather than effect change abroad. In 2021, Xi even appeared to try and roll back the aggression, urging political leaders to cultivate a \u201creliable, admirable and respectable\u201d international image. State propaganda machinery has spent billions of dollars portraying the image of a \u201ccute\u201d China on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook \u2014 both blocked to regular Chinese behind the \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d \u2014 according to an analysis by the US think tank Freedom House. \nBeijing has increasingly leveraged its economic and soft power to get its way on the global stage. China-led initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and security grouping Shanghai Cooperation Organisation have been presented as alternatives to Western-led bodies such as the World Bank and NATO. The UN Human Rights Council voted this month against holding a debate on its own high commissioner\u2019s report that found China\u2019s actions against the Muslim Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region could constitute possible crimes against humanity. Beijing had launched an all-out offensive to dismiss the report, with observers saying African countries faced particularly heavy lobbying.

Her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party \u2014 Eurosceptic and anti-immigration \u2014 won September 25 legislative polls but needs outside support to form a government. Following two days of cross-party talks, the 45-year-old from Rome is now all but certain to be asked to form a government and become the country\u2019s first woman prime minister. \u201cWe are ready to give Italy a government which will face the emergencies and the challenges of our time with awareness and competence,\u201d Meloni tweeted late Thursday. Her Brothers of Italy party won 26 percent of the vote last month, compared to eight and nine percent respectively for her allies Forza Italia and the far-right League. Her appointment would be a historic change for the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy and for Brothers of Italy, which has never been in government. Tradition dictates that President Sergio Mattarella will only name her after holding formal talks with all parties in parliament. On Friday, Meloni joined representatives of her coalition to meet Mattarella, with speculation she could be asked to form a government as early as this afternoon. If she confirms she is able to govern with her allies, she could be sworn in with her ministers over the weekend, with a vote of confidence in parliament next week. \nThe consultations to cobble a government have been overshadowed by disagreements over Meloni\u2019s ardent support for Ukraine since the Russian invasion with her two would-be coalition partners both considered close to Moscow. A recording was leaked in which Italy\u2019s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 who heads Forza Italia \u2014 talks about his warm ties with Moscow and appeared to blame the war in Ukraine on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Her other coalition partner, Matteo Salvini leader of the League party, is a long-time fan of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has criticised Western sanctions on Russia. Despite her Eurosceptic stance, Meloni has been firm about her support for Ukraine, in line with the rest of the European Union and the United States. \u201cI intend to lead a government with a clear and unequivocal foreign policy line,\u201d she has said. \u201cItaly is fully, and with its head held high, part of Europe and the Atlantic Alliance.\u201d \u201cAnyone who does not agree with this cornerstone will not be able to be part of the government, even at the cost of not forming a government,\u201d Meloni has warned. Berlusconi, 86, has said that his personal and political position \u201cdoes not deviate from that of the Italian government (and) the European Union\u201d on Ukraine. But the tensions add to concerns that Meloni\u2019s coalition, held together by the need for a parliamentary majority, will struggle to maintain unity. Berlusconi\u2019s allies insist his comments in the recording, from a meeting with lawmakers earlier this week, were taken out of context. The billionaire media mogul described a rekindling of relations with long-time friend Putin, whom he said sent him 20 bottles of vodka and a \u201cvery sweet letter\u201d for his birthday. Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party said the anecdote was an old one, although in the same recording he also expressed concerns about Italy arming Ukraine.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/far-right-meloni-set-to-become-italys-first-woman-pm/"},

Imumolen, who at 39 is the youngest amongst the 18 candidates vying for the seat of Nigeria\u2019s president in next February\u2019s presidential election, says no one can know the psychology and unique peculiarities of the youth more than a youth. He said he is not amused by the attempts of some of his fellow presidential candidates to create the impression that they are youths when they are actually not, saying it would be a colossal error by the youths themselves to be hoodwinked into endorsing such candidates.   \u201cThe clamour by the younger segment of the population for a president of youth extraction probably led to some persons migrating to other political parties and attempting to dress themselves in the garbs of youths,\u201d Imumolen said, during a recent interview in Lagos. \u201cBut we all know that once a person grows past a certain age bracket, he can no longer be referred to as a youth. \u201cSo, strictly following that analogy, I can unabashedly say that I am the only authentic youth going into the 2023 presidential elections. I need to make this categorically clear in order to sensitise the youths in this regard. \u201cNow, beyond making that clarification, I want to let the youths know that I represent their voices, that I am the one who knows their problems and therefore naturally positioned to solve them. \u201cThey should know that this is a unique opportunity for them to make a bold statement about the much sought-after paradigm shift in the power equation of this country. \u201cI want them to know that, being in the most active and largest segment of the population, they hold the aces as regards wresting power from the older generation that haven\u2019t offered them anything for decades. \u201cI want them to be analytical, clear-minded in making their choices. They should not be moved by the gibe rhetoric of some candidates who are trying vainly to not only pass themselves off as youths, but claim knowledge of their deepest desires and aspirations. \u201cI, Professor Christopher Imumolen, is offering the youths a future. A future where they will be appreciated, where their talents, intellect, abilities, innovativeness and resourcefulness would be positively engaged and utilised for the good of themselves, and the country. \u201cI make a solemn promise to them. No hardworking, progressively-minded youth in Nigeria will be left abandoned and uncared for if I earn their mandate to become the country\u2019s next president,\u201d he added. \n", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "politics", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/candidates-dressing-themselves-in-garbs-of-youths-do-not-know-nigerias-problem-imumolen/"},

Rhodes-Vivour, who spoke during his campaign flag-off at Ijegun in the Alimosho Council of the state, promised to run a government of transparency and accountability if elected into office. While addressing party members, Rhodes-Vivour lamented the deplorable state of the road in the axis, assuring the people that he was ready to tackle the infrastructure deficit in the state. He added that the reason his campaign was flagged off in Alimosho was that it is one of the most populated councils in the state, and records the highest turnout of voters. Rhodes-Vivour noted that despite the axis\u2019 political participation, it was shameful there is no development that the people can boast of, saying the current administration has done nothing to salvage the situation since their emergence in office. He said: \u201cWe are here to highlight the needs of the people. Lagos is more than Ikeja or Lekki. This is Lagos and there is a need to make these people feel the presence of the government. This is why they must elect a governor that will sympathise with them in 2023. See the deplorable state of the road that the people are battling with, this is unacceptable. This is the time for people to be aware that they can have basic amenities if they vote for the right person. \u201cWe are not campaigning, this is a movement and we are doing things to empower that movement to make people have a sense of belonging that this is their project.

{"headline": "Johnson eyes comeback as UK Tories race to replace Truss", "image_url": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/plugins/ventra-lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif", "author": "AFP", "posted_date": "21 October 2022 \u00a0 | \u00a0\n                9:40 am", "description": "Contenders to succeed British Prime Minister Liz Truss canvassed for support Friday, with her predecessor Boris Johnson reportedly considering a sensational comeback as he picks up dozens of early nominations from Conservative MPs. Truss\u2019s announcement Thursday that she will resign after less than seven weeks in office has also prompted renewed calls from opposition parties for an early general election to end months of political chaos. After her tax-slashing mini-budget last month sparked economic turmoil, two departures from her new cabinet and an eventual revolt by Tory lawmakers, Truss admitted she \u201ccannot deliver the mandate\u201d party members had handed her in the prior leadership contest. British newspapers featured sombre images of Truss\u2019s last speech outside the door of No. 10 Downing Street, with leftwing broadsheet The Guardian headlining its front page: \u201cThe bitter end\u201d. Truss only succeeded Johnson on September 6 after a weeks-long campaign against Tory rival Rishi Sunak, vowing a radical overhaul as Britons struggle with a cost-of-living crisis. Having warned correctly of the disastrous consequences of her debt-fuelled tax promises, former finance minister Sunak has emerged as an early favourite to succeed Truss. But the scandal-tarred Johnson may also be in the mix for a dramatic comeback bid, despite leaving Downing Street with dismal poll ratings. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t could he\u2026\u201d read the front page headline of the Tory-supporting Daily Express tabloid. Conservative party managers announced a truncated election process, which requires candidates to garner 100 nominations from colleagues by Monday afternoon, ahead of another possible vote of members next Friday if two remain in the race. \nSo far there are no formal contenders, but the contest was widely expected to be a three-horse race between Sunak, Johnson and senior cabinet member Penny Mordaunt. Political website Guido Fawkes, which is running a rolling spreadsheet of Tory MPs\u2019 declared support, had Johnson on 52, Sunak on 47 and Mordaunt on 18 by early Friday. Rightwing broadsheet The Daily Telegraph reported Johnson was set to fly back from a holiday in the Caribbean and was urging MPs to back him. An ally told the paper that if the Tories want to avoid losing the next general election, \u201cthey need to revert\u201d to Johnson as \u201cthe guy with a mandate who is a seasoned campaigner\u201d. There are precedents, The Telegraph wrote, with Harold Wilson and Winston Churchill both returning for a second stint after leaving office \u2014 albeit not mere weeks after being forced out. Johnson in his final question time in parliament in July dropped a hint, saying: \u201chasta la vista baby\u201d. The Times reported some Tory MPs were threatening to quit the party if the divisive figure returned as leader, however. Tory MP Crispin Blunt told the BBC that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic communicator\u201d but Sunak was \u201ca much more serious personality\u201d who could impart a \u201cserious message\u201d to the country. Some senior figures including new finance minister Jeremy Hunt have already ruled themselves out, while others such as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace have remained silent. Other candidates could include a representative of the party\u2019s right such as Suella Braverman, whose resignation as interior minister Wednesday helped trigger Truss\u2019s downfall. \nContenders have until 2:00 pm (1300 GMT) on Monday to produce the minimum 100 nominations from their fellow Tory MPs. That means a maximum of three candidates will emerge from among the 357 Conservatives in the House of Commons. If necessary, they will vote to leave two candidates standing, and hold another \u201cindicative\u201d vote to tell the party membership their preferred option. If no single candidates emerges, the rank-and-file will then have their say in an online ballot next week. The Telegraph called the truncated process \u201csensible\u201d in an editorial. But for Labour and other opposition parties, the governing party is showing contempt towards the electorate. Demanding an immediate general election, more than two years ahead of schedule, Labour leader Keir Starmer said Britain \u201ccannot have another experiment\u201d. \u201cThis is not just a soap opera at the top of the Tory party \u2014 it\u2019s doing huge damage to the reputation of our country,\u201d he said as the Labour Party showed a runaway lead in the polls. The Guardian backed an early general election, saying only this would \u201cgive the British people the fresh start that they need and deserve\u201d. But former Tory minister Nicky Morgan told Times Radio that a general election was \u201cthe last thing that the country needs\u201d.", "newspaper_name": "The Guardian", "category": "news", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/world/johnson-eyes-comeback-as-uk-tories-race-to-replace-truss/"}
