David Imuse (Retd), while addressing journalists in Benin, also alleged that Edo State \u201cIn six years, Governor Obaseki has signed more MoUs, partnerships and agreements with individuals and organisations, than any state governor in Nigeria since 1960. Obaseki\u2019s Benin Enterprise and Industrial Park, Gelegele seaport, Ossiomo Power Plant, Ologbo Modular Refinery, Benin Technical College, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, Benin Creative Hub, University of Innovation, Edo North Airport project, EMOWAA are a few of the comical results of these MoUs. Yet Mr. Obaseki who has less than two years in office is proposing a scam he calls 30-year development plan for Edo State with a 2050 result date.\u201d Imuse also accused Obaseki\u2019s government of boosting the domestic debt of the state since 2016 by N75 billion, exclusive of the state\u2019s foreign debt of over $280 million from available records, making the state the second most indebted state in the country. He said the governor just forwarded a bill the State Assembly for additional N25 billion bond to further impoverish Edo citizens yet unborn. Imuse claimed But reacting, Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Mr. Chris Nehikhare, said Edo was not the second most indebted state. While describing the APC as unserious party, he urged that they do more research on how to be an opposition party. \u201cIt shows how lazy APC is. If you Google, you will know which state is most indebted or the party should contacted Debt Management Office (DMO) to get their facts right.\u201d He explained that borrowing was not a bad thing as long as it was deployed to improve infrastructure in the state.

In a chat with aviation reporters recently, he also revealed that the agency would invest N36.2 billion and $12.9 million in overhauling the air space security architecture. On ageing workforce, he said: \u201cWe are expecting to have a good number of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) and air traffic engineers that would be retiring before the end of the year. And before now, we have made concerted efforts to bridge the gap. We currently have three batches of ATC in training at Zaria. We recruited some this year and we had two batches that were recruited last year and in training at Aviation College in Zaria at various stages. \u201cWe have made formal requests to the Minister of Aviation to recruit 100 ATC in preparation for the shortfall that will arise as a result of retirement expected this year. We are awaiting that approval to be able to commence recruitment and training. I have also noticed that we have new airports coming on stream nationwide and we are thinking strongly of that by doing manpower requirement for technical personnel. \u201cAt a glance, we have over 10 new airports and we are hoping they will come on stream. That is manpower requirement and it comes with a cost. So, we have to be prepared. We are quite mindful of these requirements and the need to fill up the gap. As an agency of government, we cannot recruit without the approval of the government. We are very certain that we will get approval from the minister very soon for us to recruit and train ATC. \u201cCertainly, next year again, we will also make a request, it is a yearly thing and the number may not be much because when you recruit, you have to train. You have to balance your intake and the capacity of the training institutions. So, that is a major prerequisite for the intake. So, on that I can say, yes, we are preparing to replace the ageing workforce that are expected to retire and also provide adequate manpower staffing for the airports that are coming up.\u201d He said NAMA has undertaken a holistic approach to improve the country\u2019s airspace by committing N36 billion for the overhaul of the country\u2019s air traffic management system, including the Safe Tower Project (STP). Included in the STP is the upgrade of the air traffic management system, surveillance system, and meteorological system in the four major airports in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kano. The breakdown shows that the agency through the Federal Government had approved N13 billion for the Safe Tower Project (STP), N23.2 billion for the upgrade of the soft and hardware of the Total Radar Coverage, otherwise known as TRACON. The agency is at the completion stage of its pet project, the Wide Area Multi-\u201clateration (WAM) system, which is a surveillance system to cover Nigeria\u2019s delta region and whose cost was put at $12.9 million.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "business", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/nama-to-employ-air-traffic-controllers-overhaul-safety-with-n36-2bn-12-9m/"},
{"headline": "Nigeria Decides 2023: Peter Obi\u2019ll be blessing to Nigeria \u2013Nanaghan, Spokesman of Mandate for Peter Obi", "image_url": "https://sunnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2-26.jpg", "author": "Rapheal", "posted_date": "21st October 2022", "description": " Nanaghan, Spokesman of the Mandate for Peter Obi 2023 has said Labour Party\u2019s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, is the man to beat in next year\u2019s election because of the wide acceptance from Nigerians. In this interview, he speaks on what the group is all about, winning strategy Peter Obi\u2019s campaign managers must use in the forthcoming election among others. What is it about MANPO\u201923? The MANPO\u201923 means the mandate for Peter Obi for the year 2023. By this, we mean that we in the MANPO\u201923 as a microcosm of the Nigerian electorate have commissioned Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed to rescue Nigeria from the lions den of old politicians and return Nigeria to the teeming, oppressed and hungry youths as their eternal democratic and political inheritance. So, the MANPO\u201923 is a specific commission and mandate to Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed to carry out a course of action, policy and assignment; the mandate to Peter Obi and Datty Baba Ahmed to carry out a course of policy and assignment as ordered by the MANPO \u201923 group representing the Nigerian electorate. Considering the unprecedented ovation Peter Obi\u2019s candidature has been receiving both within and without Nigeria, would you rather say that his exit from the PDP is a blessing? The philosophical and the didactic implications of Mr. Peter Obi\u2019s withdrawal from the Peoples Democratic Party, the PDP is that the moral content of Peter Obi\u2019s withdrawal from the PDP is insinuative and deep beyond peripheral understanding. Peter Obi cannot wine and dine with people with a high propensity for corruption, a naturally high tendency to disloyalty, a people with a proven inability to say and stick to the truth all the time, a people with an indisputable propensity for poor and selfish judgments; a people with an unyielding reliance on marabouts (native doctors), a people totally lacking in transparency and a people who are ready to sacrifice morality, integrity, propriety, truth, and national interest for self and selfish interests. Yes, of course his exit from the PDP is not only a blessing to Peter Obi but also to the Labour Party, the millions of deprived and badly misruled Nigerian masses and to the Nigerian nation as a whole. Stepping down of other Presidential aspirants in the Labour Party, how does it portray the acceptability and confidence in Mr. Peter Obi in the forthcoming presidential election? The Labour Party, before Mr. Peter Obi\u2019s glorious and glamorous introduction was a party struggling for survival and in the throes of unavoidable demise. But on Peter Obi\u2019s \u2018s entry into the Labour Party, the p arty developed a rapid survival instinct and made a determination not to be bludgeoned and battered into submission and political non existence by the other political parties. In fact, Peter Obi\u2019s membership of the Labour Party resuscitated and rebranded the dying party and infused it with energy, vitality and vigour. Before Peter Obi\u2019s advent, the Labour party was intricately engulfed in both inter and intra party squabbles that nearly blew breath out of the party. The party was splintered into several factions with different chairmen and presidential candidates. The former chairman of the Labour Party in Anambra State, Jude Ezewafor had been declared presidential candidate of a faction of the Labour Party in Abuja on June 8th, 2022 but the tactful handling of the internal crisis of the Labour Party by its chairman, Julius Abure and his National Working Committee party stakeholders like Jude Ezewafor, Callistus Okafor saved the day for the party. It led to the approval and contributions of some of the stakeholders while confirming Peter Obi\u2019s acceptability and popularity within the party all over Nigeria and throughout the world. The Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesome Wike was at a time rumoured to be interested in joining the Labour Party. Sir, do you see Governor Wike coming down from his Olympian heights to a young party like the Labour Party? Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State is a highly unpredictable character and so very difficult to bet on. Governor Wike was floored by Atiku Abubakar and he was denied the PDP presidential candidature by Governor Tambuwal\u2019s unceremonious withdrawal from the PDP presidential primary election in Abuja. Governor Wike was further incensed by Governor Okowa\u2019s betrayal for accepting to become vice presidential candidate to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. For Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa, the greatest Southern advocate for a Southern Nigerian President to accept to be Vice President of a Northern Candidate is the betrayal and back stabbing that Governor Wike can accept. Governor Wike is a smart politician and he has kept the whole world guessing what his next plans would be. However, my prediction is that even though Gov. Wike will silently work for Mr. Peter Obi but he will not defect to the Labour Party, neither will he resign his membership of the PDP. Governor Wike is smart and holds the ace in this card shuffling streak of irreconcilable opposites with Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. If you are in the team of Mr. Peter Obi\u2019s managers, what winning strategy will you be adopting in your campaign? There is no particular winning strategy in political campaigns. Many politicians have won their electoral victories by employing various campaign techniques and strategies, but the most popular is the grassroots mobilisation strategy. Grassroots mobilisation advocacy assembles a whole gamut of preferences and strategies. These include the door- to- door campaign strategy, television /radio/print media adverts, billboards, etc. For instance, President Barack Obama used the door-to-door approach to win the American presidential elections of 2008 and 2012. However, the Nigerian electorate is massively ignorant; poor, uninformed and illiterate. Yeah, the Nigerian electorate is only influenced by material incentives like money, foodstuffs and other material advantages. In 2015, the All Progressives Congress (APC) imported the American vote programmer, Mr. David Axelrod, to plan a strategy of highfalutin deceptions and unachievable fallacies to hoodwink the illiterate Nigerian electorate. China\u2019s greatest war strategist, Sun Tzu postulated that, \u201cin the mindset of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d. There\u2019s chaos in Nigeria right now so I will advise Peter Obi\u2019s managers to massively mobilise the entire nation for the practical takeover of Nigeria from old politicians who have swallowed all our natural resources and commonwealth. Peter Obi\u2019s campaign managers must take advantage of the national dissatisfaction and unrest to push the Nigerian electorate into a revolutionary frenzy and mass mobilisation for the final take over of the country by a people-friendly government. Peter Obi of the Labour Party has been described as the man to beat in the 2023 general elections, do you agree with this assessment? This your question is a rhetorical question, so let me answer it with another question with a quotation from the radical French writer, poet, and essayist, Monsieur Victor Hugo. He said, \u201cnothing else in the world \u2013 not even all the armies in the world \u2013 is so powerful as an idea whose time has come.\u201d The Peter Obi movement cannot be stopped, not even by Mr. Peter himself. He cannot disembark from the train or stop the movement of this train. The MANPO\u201923 believes that Peter Obi is the man to beat because even five serving state governors are tactically and strategically backing him. The Edo State House of Assembly has tacitly endorsed him. On the 30th July 2022, the powerful and dependable socio-cultural voice of the Yoruba Nation, Afenifere openly backed Peter Obi for President come February 2023. On August 5th, 2022, all the 15 deregistered parties by INEC declared their support for Peter Obi\u2019s Presidency under the Labour Party. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Offices nationwide have had an unprecedented bombardment due to the support all Nigerian youths have for Mr. Peter Obi. Also, organisations and coalitions for the support of Peter Obi are now over 5000 all over the country. Most prominent among these are theMANPO\u201923, Obi Save Naija, Peter Obi\u2019s Success Group, PO Think Tank, The New Nigeria group, the Good Governance group, PO Network, United Nigeria group and The United Nigerian Youths for Peter Obi. On the 22nd of May, 2022, the Nigerian Bar Association Annual Conference was thrown into a rancorous and wild celebration shout of Obi, Obi, Obi for over 20 minutes as the Labour Party flag bearer stormed the venue. Peter Obi has received thunderous ovations in both churches and mosques all over Nigeria. We in the MANPO\u201923 know that some people have perfected plans to thwart the efforts of opposition parties to discourage their members in the forthcoming presidential elections. But we believe God Almighty will thwart their evil plans and Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti Baba \u2013 Ahmed will emerge as President and Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come February 2023.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/nigeria-decides-2023-peter-obill-be-blessing-to-nigeria-nanaghan-spokesman-of-mandate-for-peter-obi/"},

Reacting to those who said He said the same reason that disqualified the north from aspiring to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 after his eight-year reign also applied to the South West and South South having produced Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, respectably as presidents. \u201cWhen you mouth equity, you don\u2019t disembark; it takes you to the very end which is justice.

So, Afenifere\u2019s support was based on the principle of justice.\u201d He said Afenifere was in support of a country where every group would have a sense of belonging.

He also lamented inheriting an over-blotted secretariat staff strength, numbering over 200 that populated its payroll without any job schedule, specifications and appointment letters. The former governor of Nasarawa State who spoke during a parley with correspondents covering the ruling party at the secretariat in Abuja, dismissed speculations that he sent directors on indefinite suspension, sacked and replaced them with his relatives. However, reacting to the allegations, a source close to the CECPC chairman said Governor Buni would not be in any hurry to respond to such weighty allegations, adding: \u201cWe will wait till we read it first before responding.\u201d On allegations that he suspended directors and replaced with persons close to him, Adamu fumed that: \u201cthe true picture is that such report is false. It is all negative. The fact of the matter is that if you go through this secretariat there is no person employed since I took over that is related with me. Not one is a member of my family, immediate or extended. The report is s fallacy. \u201cWhen we came in here, we resolved to reorganise this party. You don\u2019t see the party in a state of mess and allow the order you inherited to continue just because you want to be descent and not offend anybody. We came and found the party where people are fixing all manners of things. We had a bill of about N7.5 billion only legal to settle. \u201cWe came to find out that everybody was on his own, doing whatever they want to do. There was no control, no system, no due process and just because we don\u2019t want to be accused of anything we allow all those kind of things to continue. My DNA has terrible allergy for that. And I am sure that most of, if not all my members are the same. We therefore found it a necessity to reorganise the entire place. Only God knows the extent of appreciation from people. Every situation change has a victim and here is not an exception. We didn\u2019t do anything with any bias or prejudice on our part. The main thing is for the interest of the party and to reposition it ahead of the election year. We will be abused and falsely accused but it is for the good of the party.\u201d On the over-blotted staff, he said: \u201cOnly recently, we tried to introduce table payments. All of us in this secretariat know that we don\u2019t have up to 200 staff strength but if you go through the payroll we have over 200 staff. The big questions are, who are they and how did they come into the payroll, what are they doing for us, what is the nature of their job schedule, where is their letter of appointment and what condition of service do they have? \u201cWe cannot because we are afraid of negative media allow it to continue. If we continue like that, we cannot pay salaries and that is the truth. We have no regret over who has been told to go on suspension or their replacement because we did everything in good faith,\u201d he declared. On unveiling of the party\u2019s manifesto and inauguration of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), the party\u2019s boss said: \u201cLet us not preempt what the candidate of our party will unveiling to Nigerians. We must wait to hear from him concerning what we are going present to Nigerians.\u201d On current status of the aggrieved presidential aspirants and their readiness to key into the party\u2019s programmes, he said: \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, the aspirants are keying into what the party is doing. One thing you owe yourself as journalists is to interact with each of the aspirants who are still alive. I don\u2019t see any reason the media has not taken the initiative, having observed such, to investigate where they stand today. \u201cIt is not good for me to start talking for them if what you noticed is very abnormal.

On Wednesday, October 5, the World Teachers Day, Teni displayed her kind-heartedness as she stormed her alma mater, Apata Memorial High School, Ire Akari Estate, Isolo, Lagos where she presented a car gift to her former tutor. While presenting the key of a white Lexus car to Kelvin Ofudje, her former Mathematics teacher, Teni recalled how he was so tough on her not knowing he was only piloting her in the right direction. \u201cTeachers are special. I actually came here this morning to celebrate with the teachers. Also, I have a surprise for one of my special teachers that did an amazing job on me while I was in this school. Mr. Ofudje, I am very grateful for all your hard work. I appreciate your diligence, your integrity and hard work, and so I decided to buy you a car,\u201d the musician announced to a tumultuous applause from the students. However, speaking exclusively to Sunday Sun shortly after the presentation, Teni said she had singled out Kelvin Ofudje for a car gift not only for what he has done in her life, but also because she has always wanted to touch teachers\u2019 lives. \u201cSince I was young, I\u2019ve always had it in mind to give back to teachers because my parents are educationists. I have seen the impact that teachers have on the lives of children or students or anyone that comes across their paths. Somebody taught us everything we know today. I see the sacrifices that teachers make just to make sure that people\u2019s lives are better,\u201d she explained. In an emotion-laden voice, Ofudje expressed surprise at Teni\u2019s gesture. According to him, in his widest imagination, he never expected to be given a car just like that. \u201cI am short of words. I never expected this. I was only doing my job in my usual self. This is the way I was brought up. My parents, especially my mother who died about two years ago, brought me up to be hard working. Everything you are seeing about me today is due to my upbringing. At a time, some people thought I was Teni\u2019s father because I was acting more like a daddy to her. I thank the family, most especially Teni, because it\u2019s not everybody you teach that would remember you. When I was teaching Teni many years ago, to her, I was a very wicked man. I was actually tough on her. If I didn\u2019t see Teni in the lesson class, I would summon her and give her three or four strokes of the cane. Her mother would look for me and ask, \u2018Mr Kelvin, what happened? Why did you flog my child?\u2019 I would tell her it\u2019s because she skipped lesson class, and her mother wouldn\u2019t mind. What a wonderful mother she is. That\u2019s what we are celebrating today,\u201d the teacher reminisced. But then, is this kind gesture a one-off thing or will Teni continue on this philanthropic path? Her response: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going to be a one-off thing.

According to the bank, this is expected to happen because the Naira is well above fair value. This was disclosed by the bank\u2019s economist, Tatonga Rusike via an emailed note seen by Daily Sun on Wednesday. Rusike said that the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) foreign exchange strategy has resulted in a significant premium between official and parallel market rates, adding that the apex bank\u2019s major move next year may be a devaluation to bridge the deficit. According to Rusike, the naira is 20 per cent overpriced. He noted that the projection was based on three indicators: the popular black-market rate, central bank\u2019s real effective exchange rate and the Bank of America\u2019s currency fair value research. Rusike said, \u201cWe see scope for it to weaken by an equivalent amount over the next six-nine months, taking it to as high as N520 per USD.\u201d In the meantime, devaluation of the naira is unlikely to happen until after the February 2023 presidential elections. This is despite the fact that the naira will likely come under increasing pressure due to limited government external borrowing\u201d. The bank also warned that the greater the disparity with the official market, the higher the likelihood of increasing excess demand for foreign currency on the parallel market. Reacting to the US bank\u2019s projections, Managing Director, HighCap Securities, David Adonri, noted that the projection is quite rational and conservative. When I did a calculation at about 2-3 years ago, the value of the Naira at that time was N800/$1. But as it is now, the official rate which is N441/$1 is completely over-valued which is the reason the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is struggling to defend it. Whereas the parallel market is close to what the real value of the Naira is. So at the end of the day if the Naira is floated, I expected it to be between N680 and N700 and this is owing to what is happening currently this year. Next year, macroeconomic conditions may change because it is difficult to predict what next year will look like but if the conditions does not improve, then we should be seeing the real value of the Naira at N800/$1\u201d, Adonri said. Daily Sun investigations revealed that as at 11:25 am on Wednesday, the price of the dollar kept hovering around N737 and N740. Nigerians and most especially businesses have continued to lament, while urging the Federal Government to create a stable exchange rate and more transaction channels.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "business", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/nairall-devalue-to-n520-by-2023-bank-of-america-2/"},

He recalled that since the subsidy on gas (diesel) was withdrawn, it has not guaranteed cheaper product nor its availability, but has triggered price increase on all commodities and\u00a0worsened inflation, as it now sells at N850 per litre, and yet still scarce in many jurisdictions. Hassan\u2019s reaction in a statement released to newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday, was against the backdrop of the el-Rufai and Sanusi\u2019s comments at the 7th edition of the Kaduna Economic and Investment Summit on Tuesday where the former Emir raised the alarm that more traumatising economic challenges awaited Nigeria\u2019s incoming president in 2023, against the backdrop of petroleum subsidy and debt servicing challenges. He allayed fears that with the giant strides being taken by the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Ltd (NNPCL), Mr Mele Kyari, in reforming the oil sector as well as\u00a0 the passing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari and its implementation in actualising the reformation, there was no cause for such an alarm. \u201cKyari\u2019s is a go-getter any day. His poise to unravel oil theft in Nigeria, especially in the Niger Delta, which is already yielding positive result, as well as other transformative measures he has embarked upon, is highly commendable. He has also propelled Nigeria to a hub of refined petroleum products in Africa.\u00a0 \u201cThe reformation would surely guarantee a staggering growth as well as economic prosperity for not only the oil sector but also the common man. This is the vision that Mele Kyari is striving to achieve,\u201d Hassan said. He added: \u201cInstead of making dispiriting comments as if the efforts being made to bring success to us all are not relevant, whereas they are very crucial and important, it is high time we started appreciating Kyari\u2019s foresight, selfless patriotism and commitment in ensuring stability of the nation\u2019s oil industry and the economic prosperity, growth and development being earnestly yearned for.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemoval of oil subsidy is a critical issue. There is need to weigh it well and ensure a balance before taking a decision on it. The pros and cons need to be looked at critically before a decision has to be made. It is not something to rush. It should be gradual to make it result-oriented for the growth and economic development that we all desire and deserve,\u201d Hassan stressed.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "business", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/petrol-subsidy-removalll-worsen-citizens-hardship-oil-marketer/"},

According to the bank, this is expected to happen because the Naira is well above fair value. This was disclosed by the bank\u2019s economist, Tatonga Rusike via an emailed note seen by Daily Sun on Wednesday. Rusike said that the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) foreign exchange strategy has resulted in a significant premium between official and parallel market rates, adding that the apex bank\u2019s major move next year may be a devaluation to bridge the deficit. According to Rusike, the naira is 20 per cent overpriced. He noted that the projection was based on three indicators: the popular black-market rate, central bank\u2019s real effective exchange rate and the Bank of America\u2019s currency fair value research. Rusike said, \u201cWe see scope for it to weaken by an equivalent amount over the next six-nine months, taking it to as high as N520 per USD.\u201d In the meantime, devaluation of the naira is unlikely to happen until after the February 2023 presidential elections. This is despite the fact that the naira will likely come under increasing pressure due to limited government external borrowing\u201d. The bank also warned that the greater the disparity with the official market, the higher the likelihood of increasing excess demand for foreign currency on the parallel market. Reacting to the US bank\u2019s projections, Managing Director, HighCap Securities, David Adonri, noted that the projection is quite rational and conservative. When I did a calculation at about 2-3 years ago, the value of the Naira at that time was N800/$1. But as it is now, the official rate which is N441/$1 is completely over-valued which is the reason the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is struggling to defend it. Whereas the parallel market is close to what the real value of the Naira is. So at the end of the day if the Naira is floated, I expected it to be between N680 and N700 and this is owing to what is happening currently this year. Next year, macroeconomic conditions may change because it is difficult to predict what next year will look like but if the conditions does not improve, then we should be seeing the real value of the Naira at N800/$1\u201d, Adonri said. Daily Sun investigations revealed that as at 11:25 am on Wednesday, the price of the dollar kept hovering around N737 and N740. Nigerians and most especially businesses have continued to lament, while urging the Federal Government to create a stable exchange rate and more transaction channels.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "business", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/nairall-devalue-to-n520-by-2023-bank-of-america/"},

To this end, the Federal Government said it is striving to reduce it\u00a0 at 50 per cent over the medium term period and ultimately take it down to 30 per cent. Speaking in Abuja during the presentation of 2023 Budget, the minister said government was taking steps to shore up its revenue base. Such steps include to grant tax rebate, make\u00a0 provisions for free registration etc. \u201cAs at August 31, Nigeria\u2019s debt service to revenue ratio was at 83 per cent\u00a0 and that is why I said that what we have is a revenue challenge and we have to do everything we can to increase our revenue.\u00a0 Our policy target is to keep it at no more than 50 per cent over the medium term period and ultimately reduce it down to 30 per cent\u00a0 but we are currently over 50 per cent debt service to revenue\u201d he said. On how to shore up revenue, the minister explained that tax rebate should be granted with free registration at Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) is ongoing. \u201cIt\u2019s first of all to try to get the sector formalised.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the reasons we make provisions for free registration and online registration. You can actually go to\u00a0 CAC website and register.\u00a0 If you have all the documents,\u00a0\u00a0 within 48 hours you\u2019ll\u00a0 get your certificate. So, once you register, the process of registration includes you\u2019ll provide your TIN, you\u2019ll provide your account number and BVN also.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier to track those companies and since that provision was given, the Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment is reporting that there are more of these\u00a0 informal sector operators that are not formalised. Remember that I said we granted tax rebate for small businesses but the businesses were still expected to file in returns to show that their turnover is below those threshold that\u2019s either entitled to zero CIT or 20 per cent CIT.\u00a0 So, gradually the tax net is able to include some of these informal sector businesses. More currently,\u00a0 the JTB is chaired by the chairman.\u00a0 FIRS chairman\u00a0 is working with each state chairman of FIRS as a member.\u00a0 They are currently working at upgrading the process of TIN to include NIN and you know that there is a lot of progress that has been made in the NIN registration process.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "business", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/83-debt-service-to-revenue-threat-to-economy-minister/"},

{"headline": "Nigeria Decides 2023: Resort to religious, ethnic politics deepen cracks", "image_url": "https://sunnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2-24.jpg", "author": "Rapheal", "posted_date": "20th October 2022", "description": "By   campaigns for the 2023 general election have started in earnest and the atmosphere is gradually being charged with political statements and slogans. Nigerians are anxiously waiting to go to the polls to elect a new set of leaders. But, there are concerns in many quarters on whether the twin campaign tools of religion and ethnicity will still be the major determinant of electoral victories as they had always been. Those who express this fear would always cast their minds back to the first parliamentary elections in 1959; shortly before Nigeria\u2019s independence in 1960, and subsequent elections up to as recent as the 2019 general election. They agreed that the December 12, 1959 parliamentary election, which was dominated by the three major political parties at that time, the Northern People\u2019s Congress (NPC), the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons, later the National Convention of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC), and the Action Group (AG), was characterised by the highest level of ethnic, religious and sectional politics. Eventually, the NPC won 134 seats out of the 312 seats in the House of Representatives, while the remaining votes were shared between the NCNC and AG. Close watchers of political developments in Nigeria are very quick to trace the ethnic division, which has today clogged Nigeria\u2019s wheel of growth and development to the rancour, animosity and mistrust that followed the outcome of the 1959 parliamentary election results. Regrettably, however, those divisive tools of religion, ethnicity and sectional sentiments have remained the potent instruments, which politicians have readily deployed at any material time to their own political advantage, leaving the masses to wantonly abuse, hate and even kill themselves. Since September 28, when the electoral umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), blew the whistle setting in motion the campaigns for the 2023 presidential election, political gladiators and their supporters have already started oiling their sectional, religious and ethnic tools to be massively deployed just to hoodwink and blindfold the poor masses into casting their votes for them. It is a deliberate ploy by the politicians to gain electoral mileage in the 2023 elections and satisfy their political ambitions, not minding the fate of their supposed brethrens in the same ethnicity or religious faith. But, there is a new political development in the horizon. Never in the chequered Nigeria\u2019s political history have the youths shown the kind of preparedness and willingness to actively participate in the electoral process as they have shown in the build up to the 2023 elections. The youths appear to have woken up from their age-long slumber and shown determination to take back Nigeria from those who have used religion and ethnicity to divide and rule them blindly over the years. They appear determined to restore the patriotic and nationalistic principle upon which the foundation of Nigeria is supposedly standing by engendering the true spirit of brotherhood devoid of ethnic, religious or sectional differences. Many youths insist that campaigns about the 2023 general elections should be issues based; and that voters should consider candidates based on merit rather than their religious, tribal or sectional affiliations. The battle line seems to have been drawn between the old order that employs religious and ethnic tools to campaign for elections and the new order that promotes peace and unity through issues-based campaigns, which only recognize merit, irrespective of the candidate\u2019s religion, tribe or political party. However, there are concerns in some quarters that even with the push by the youths and most Nigerians that the campaigns should be dominated by issues that affect the people\u2019s lives positively, there are still some sinister moves by some politicians and their lackeys to employ the tools of religion and ethnicity, even if subtly, to create divisions among Nigerians to achieve their selfish aim of winning elections at all cost. The fear and concern of possible deployment of religion and ethnicity as campaign tools have been demonstrated at one time or the other by both candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Just on Saturday, October 15, at the Arewa Joint Committee interactive sessions with various presidential candidates of political parties in Kaduna, the PDP candidate was quoted to have said that the North does not need an Igbo or Yoruba president, but someone from the North, ostensibly referring to himself. He was quoted to have said: \u201cI have traversed the whole of this country. I know the whole of this country. I have built bridges across the country. What the average Northerner needs is somebody who is from the North and also understands that part of the country and has been able to build bridges across the country. This is what the northerner needs; he doesn\u2019t need a Yoruba or an Igbo candidate. This is what the northerner needs. I stand before you as a pan-Nigerian of Northern origin.\u201d A cross section of Nigerians has reacted to the statement credited to Atiku, with some describing him as an ethnic bigot who is trying to deploy ethnic sentiment to his electoral advantage. Even the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has joined the fray calling on Atiku to apologise to the Igbo and the entire Southern Nigeria for bringing divisive politics into his campaigns. However, the APC candidate also recently described the PDP as a political party of termites that should not be allowed to return to power, instead of telling Nigerians what it wants to do for them if voted into power. Tinubu is alleged to have made the statement in his address at the inauguration of the APC Women Tinubu-Shettima Campaign Team, at the Old Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said: \u201cThey are a political party of termites. They are in the village of lunacy. A nation is not just built on abusive language. It has been sixteen years of nothingness, rudderlessness, digging the hole of indebtedness. Never again shall they come back. A new hope is here.\u201d The APC is also alleged to have said that those who are not in support of his candidacy are the enemies of the Yoruba race; a statement many have said is tantamount to whipping up ethnic sentiment to gain electoral mileage ahead of the 2023 presidential election. But, the question is: \u201cWill Nigerians allow politicians to divide them with religion and ethnicity this time around, or will they ask politicians to tell them how they can create a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria, where everybody will live in love and unity, irrespective of one\u2019s religion or ethnicity?\u201d  Lending his voice to the conversation, the president of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus argued that every rational Nigerian would prefer an issue-based campaign. He warned Nigerians to look at the track records of whomever that is campaigning to determine whether the person has been sincere or deceitful. \u201cHow did the person emerge? People who bought their way to get the ticket should not be listened to. People who deceived their opponents, telling lies from all sides of their mouths would do the same thing when they get to office, so Nigerians should not listen to such persons. So, the campaign should be issue based,\u201d he stressed. He said what is happening in Nigeria today should serve as a big lesson to the people in the North because in 2014, it was more of religion and ethnicity and everybody followed the \u2018Sai Baba,\u2019 slogan without critically looking at the issues. \u201cToday, everybody is crying. Go to the North and see that they are crying more than other people and it is simply because rather than chose issue based campaigns, they preferred religion and ethnicity. That should stop. We have people who are brilliant and young with good track records out there; let Nigerians look at what is needful to birth the new Nigeria we need to address the issues we are facing, so that we can have a better country. So, campaigns should be issues-based; not religion and ethnicity,\u201d he submitted. However, the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, also noted that the use of religion and ethnicity to campaign for elections has been the problem of Nigeria all the while. He lamented that the politicians are still not prepared to change but expressed confidence that something would change them this time around. \u201cSomebody has to raise the bar above the pedestrian and mundane of religion and ethnicity. On the other hand, somebody must be able to create a philosophical framework upon which a new ideology that is touching the heart of everybody is created. It should go beyond religion and ethnicity,\u201d he said. He argued that of all the sentiments that politicians use to campaign for election, especially in Nigeria, the one of ethnicity is the strongest; it is stronger than that of religion. He, however, noted that the one that is stronger than ethnicity is economic sentiment because it has no boundary. \u201cWhether you are Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, Efik, Ijaw, Benin or whatever tribe, you can\u2019t survive hunger for a long time. So, the moment you see a window through which you can overcome your poverty; you will grab it because that is the way to go. So, what is important in all the campaign promises or manifesto is that person who will be able to create a better economy for everybody. The moment the person with the resourcefulness, the ingenuity and the intellect to create a better economic environment that will reduce poverty, create mass employment and reduce the number of strife in Nigeria emerges, Nigerians will embrace such persons, because that is the economic sentiment which is stronger, greater and more relevant than religious and ethnic sentiments,\u201d he said. He stressed that the campaigns should not only be issues-based but also on economic revival of Nigeria. \u201cSo, of all the candidates parading themselves for the presidential election, Nigerians should look for the person who has the most robust manifesto that will turn around the economy of Nigeria; that is the person that Nigerians should follow. So, the campaign should be based on economic revival, not just on issues,\u201d he stated. Also reviewing the situation is the president of the Northern Youths Consultative Forum (NYCF), Alhaji Shettima Yerima, who condemned the use of religion or ethnicity as campaign tools, arguing that it would only divide the country further. He warned that any politician who comes forward with religion or ethnicity as a yardstick to get votes from Nigerians must be rejected as such a person does not only have nothing to offer Nigerians, but such a person is also an enemy of the country. \u201cSuch a politician should be avoided like a plague because Nigerians can\u2019t afford to use religion or ethnicity to campaign in the 2023 elections. Nigerians should know that such politicians do not have anything to offer them and should be rejected outright,\u201d he said. Yerima noted that Nigeria is so fragile at present such that what is needed is a leader with goodwill, patriotism and commitment, so that the country could be united once again. \u201cSo we can\u2019t afford to lose this chance,\u201d he added. He advised voters to look out for committed and patriotic politicians who are ready to unite Nigeria and not the ones that would divide the country further. \u201cWe have had enough of this madness, so Nigerians must be very weary and conscious of those coming forward to seek for their votes. Once they throw up tribal or religious sentiment into their campaign, they should be rejected immediately because they have nothing but chaos and hardship to offer Nigerians,\u201d he submitted.", "newspaper_name": "The Sun News Paper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/nigeria-decides-2023-resort-to-religious-ethnic-politics-deepen-cracks/"},
