Ahmed disclosed this on Thursday on Channels TV programme, Politics Today. According to him, the use of \u201cmassacre\u201d during the October 20, 2020 event is highly debatable. \u201cThere was abuse of procedure, if some people interpret that as massacre. The use of 'massacre' in #EndSARS is highly debatable but I can say for sure there were abuses of procedure and civil rights violations,\u201d he said. He added that it was \u201cheavy\u201d to say that the Labour Party was a beneficiary of the #EndSARS protest. Ahmed said, \u201cIt\u2019s a very heavy statement to make, saying that our party, Labour Party is a beneficiary of EndSARS. While we are always on the side of the people, on side of good governance, we are against attrition; we are against repression and all those. \u201cYou may be more correct to put it in another way, but we are not direct beneficiaries of EndSARS. The use of the word \u2018massacre\u2019 is highly debatable. We never wanted EndSARS to happen. We never want any Nigerian whatsoever to be attacked. Accordingly, we are not happy for anybody to say we are beneficiaries of EndSARS. \u201cWe benefit from a peaceful Nigeria. That is what we benefit from. We benefit from progress and development. We are about correcting all the mistakes of bad governance.\u201d SaharaReporters had reported that soldiers on October 20, 2020 opened fire on the protesters, who had converged at the Lekki tollgate to protest against police brutality. The incident triggered a global outrage, with calls for justice echoing from different parts of the world. It was gathered that before the shooting started, some officials uninstalled the Closed Circuit Television cameras in the area. The electricity at the protest area was also disconnected to prevent demonstrators from filming the attack. Minutes later, heavily armed Nigerian Army personnel moved into the scene to complete the plan. By the time sounds of their guns died down, dozens of protesters had been killed. Though Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu blamed \u201cforces beyond our control\u201d for the attack, the army in a statement later revealed that the soldiers were invited to the scene of protest by the governor. Also soldiers involved in the operation confirmed they were drafted in for the mission on the request of Sanwo-Olu. Angered by the killings by the army and the Lagos State Government's suspected involvement in the massacre, angry residents attacked public properties and also destroying some known investments of a former governor of the state and Presidential Candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Television Continental and The Nation Newspaper are two among several investments burnt by irate youths. The toll plaza of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, another money spinner said to be controlled by the former Lagos governor was also burnt. \n     \n  ", "newspaper_name": "Sahara Reporters", "category": "news", "url": "https://saharareporters.com//2022/10/20/endsars-i-know-abuses-lekki-tollgate-massacre-debatable-peter-obis-running-mate-datti"},

The ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday confirmed SaharaReporters\u2019 reports exposing how the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been compromised. The court ordered INEC to accept and publish the name of Godswill Akpabio as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Akwa Ibom North/West senatorial district in 2023. \u00a0 Justice Emeka Nwite, in the judgment, held that INEC acted illegally by refusing to accept and publish Akpabio\u2019s name even when it was sent to it by the APC as its candidate. Meanwhile, SaharaReporters had in the last few months reported how the compromised INEC under the leadership of Prof. Mahmood Yakubu could derail the 2023 elections. SaharaReporters earlier quoted sources saying that Yakubu had agreed to some unethical and obnoxious conditions in his bid to secure a second term in office under the All Progressives Congress-led government of President Muhammadu Buhari. \u00a0 The newspaper can confirm that the earlier reports are gradually playing out. For instance, SaharaReporters had exposed an elaborate plan by INEC and the APC to impose Senator Godswill Akpabio and Senate President Ahmad Lawan as candidates of the ruling party for the senatorial districts even though the former did not participate in the INEC validated primary election while the latter failed to participate in the senatorial primaries of his party for Yobe North. Bashir Machina had won the party\u2019s ticket for Yobe North Senatorial District, while Udom Ekpoudom won the primary for Akwa Ibom North-West, which was monitored by INEC officials. But INEC kept denying plans to scuttle the outcome of the primaries through several press releases, telling Nigerians that it stood by its report of the senatorial primaries submitted to it from the states and that both Akpabio and Senate President Lawan were not recognised as candidates. However, the judgment of the Federal High Court on Thursday, September 15 has exposed INEC's complicity and connivance with the ruling APC to impose Akpabio and Lawan as candidates. Both Lawan and Akpabio participated in the APC presidential primaries which was won by former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu and hence could not have participated in their respective APC Senatorial primary elections. SaharaReporters had cited and is in possession of court documents from the Federal High Court 6 where the case of Rtd DIG Ekpoudum vs Akpabio was first instituted, with judgment to be delivered next Tuesday. However, Akpabio in connivance with INEC Chairman, Yakubu instituted another suit at Court 7 in the same Federal High Court wherein only INEC was joined as a defendant. The processes cited so far and INEC\u2019s presence in court has exposed the electoral commission despite its weighty responsibility of conducting the forthcoming general elections. Findings by SaharaReporters also show that the various press statements of INEC vehemently stating that it would stand by its reports of the primaries monitored and submitted by its state offices, were deceptive. When Ekpoudum filed his case at the Federal High Court in Abuja on June 27, 2022, in Suit No: FHC / Abj/ CS/ 1000/2022 \u2013 \u00a0Udom Ekpoudom Vs APC & INEC, the leadership of the electoral body delayed releasing the Certified True Copy of the primary election involving Akpabio to the winner. So, the matter was filed without the report until a series of reports by SaharaReporters exposed how INEC was refusing to issue the CTC of politicians it had vested compromised interest in their cases. The stories later compelled the Commission to release the reports to lawyers awaiting them across the states to file cases for their clients. From SaharaReporters' findings, INEC in connivance with Akpabio, who was already part of the first suit, filed the same matter under the name of APC in another court and sued only INEC. \u201cINEC lent itself to the chicanery since it was working with the ruling party as it did not join Ekpoudum whose name is in INEC\u2019s senatorial primary report the body had repeatedly said it stood by. \u201cIt was for the second case the controversial judgment with Suit No: FHC/AbjCS /1011 /2022 btw APC & Akpabio Vs INEC, was delivered,\u201d a source privy to the matter told SaharaReporters on Friday. Meanwhile, INEC, which was served process on the Ekpoudum vs Akpabio case, refused to file any written response nor submit its report that it had assured Nigerians it stood by in its press releases. Basically, it refused to say so in court and was never represented by any of its lawyers throughout despite being served with hearing notices. The judgment of the court will be delivered next Tuesday, September 21, 2022. However, the leadership of INEC in Akpabio\u2019s suit with the electoral body standing alone as the defendant filed a response process and was represented by its Counsel, one Hassan Aminu on Thursday for the judgment. SaharaReporters\u2019 investigation has also established what could have been an oversight, negligence or possible compromise on the part of the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court who signed the new supposedly pre-election Federal High Court Rules of sworn affidavit of non-multiplicity of the same matter, as the CJ reassigned the same subject matter already pending in Court 6 to Court 7 with a new suit number, which happens to be the only difference. \u201cThe Director (Legal), Mrs Babalola and lawyers in the legal department, Tanimu, Hassan, Deputy Director Musa and officials of INEC Election and Political Party Monitoring Departments\u00a0are all neck deep in the compromise and corruption in the Akpabio and Lawan saga. \u201cJust last week, an INEC lawyer was in court in a similar fashion and repudiated its senatorial primary report of Yobe state senatorial primary election matter in favour of Senate President Ahmed Lawan. Public outrage and condemnation of INEC action led to a retreat through a weak denunciation without disowning the lawyer,\u201d another source privy to the matter said. The source added, \u201cThe ongoing investigation of the handling of the outcome of party primaries monitored by INEC has shown that in various states where INEC has been compromised heavily, particularly APC-controlled states, INEC refused to defend the reports of party primaries monitored by its states offices in the court yet the same INEC through Festus Okoye, who is an INEC chief official described as the new \"hand gun\" of corrupt politicians had repeatedly through press releases said it stood by the reports of primary of state offices and that Akpabio and Lawan didn't win primaries. \u201cAll these lies have been exposed by the Federal High Court\u2019s strange and curious judgment imposing Akpabio as a candidate and that of the Senate President is underway. \u201cThat was why INEC shamelessly in betrayal of public trust and the assurances it had given several times to Nigerians, showed up in court in the suit filed by Senator Akpabio where it is the only defendant and the same INEC was also in court to receive the judgment for quick compliance.\u201d \n \n \n     \n  ", "newspaper_name": "Sahara Reporters", "category": "news", "url": "https://saharareporters.com//2022/09/16/exclusive-how-nigerian-high-court-judgment-ordering-inec-accept-akpabio-apc-candidate"},

The use of 'massacre' in #EndSARS is highly debatable but I can say for sure there were abuses of procedure and civil rights violations,\u201d he had said. \u00a0 Reacting in a statement, Magashi said the words from Datti \u201cis not only embarrassing, it is an insult on humanity and an attack on the quest for total liberation of all Nigerians from the wicked hands of fascists and systematic tyranny\u201d. \u00a0 He asked why the LP VP candidate keeps portraying northerners as barbarians and people without civility. \u00a0 The statement read, \u201cIf Datti is not well read enough to understand what a massacre is, he should at least use his phone to \"verify\" as his deceitful group is wont to shouting. A massacre is \"a deliberate and brutal slaughter of many people.\" This is obviously why it is literarily termed \"cold-blooded!\" \u00a0 \u201cI understand why Datti is speaking from a watery and cunning mouth on this issue. He is a kindergarten oppressor that takes delight in acting like the enemies of the people. Datti is so conservative and anti-people that he never for once condemned and fight against all the thousands of human rights abuses in the North. \u00a0 \u201cDatti is clearly defending barbarism by this statement. His other defences are insults on the most profound Judicial Panel Report in history that critically and correctly judged the incidents at Lekki as a \"massacre!\" \u00a0 \u201cDatti keeps portraying Northerners as barbarians and people without civility. We are a very civil people. The greatest development in any part of Nigeria, in spite of Awolowo's Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN)'s gigantic presence was the Aminu Kano-led People's Redemption Party (PRP) as represented by Balarabe Musa of Kaduna and Abubakar Rimi of Kano in the Second Republic. \u00a0 \u201cThe great developments have been destroyed today by the mis-governments that have reigned after these legends. The North is a bastion of development, and the African Action Congress (AAC) is the party that is showing same tendencies today. We are happy that the great progressives in the vast North is gathering together to support Omoyele Sowore as the new revolution that can build a new Nigeria. \u00a0 \u201cLet Datti and the rest know that Northern Talakawa people will rise soon as we are most oppressed people in Nigeria. We lack almost all basic amenities. The only thing we have is people like Datti and his godfathers using the North to rake in private wealth and distort our history and good ideas. \u00a0 \u201cWhat I can assure Datti and his anti-people movement is that the wind has blown and Northerners know their actual friends and enemies. We know those who stood against the infamous Zaria Massacre of Shi'ites in Kaduna. \u201cWe know those who used their press power to fight the Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgencies. We know those who stood against the planned pogroms in Southern Kaduna. And we know those who organized and publicized the help-bringing #NorthIsBleeding. \u201cThe three fingers of Oppression parties can go on and on with their jamboree rallies. But the Talakawas are rallying Door-To-Door, and streets-to-streets for the New Hope of the Masses. The days of the people cannot be postponed anymore. This is why EndSARS must be greatly respected and justice must be ensured for all victims nationally. \u201cI also call on all governors detaining victims unjustly. Release these great comrades now! This is why our Governorship candidate in Lagos, the gentle and suave Akeem Olayiwola, will implement all the letters of the Justice Okuwobi-led Lagos State Judicial Panel on EndSARS and other related matters of police brutality immediately we are declared, insha Allah, come 2023! \u00a0 \u201cBy legal and moral standards, what happened in Lekki is not just abuse of human rights, it is a grave assault on humanity. It is a pogrom that has put thousands of people in trauma, perpetual fear, and depressions. I align with all the great EndSARS youths and the Judicial Panel that what was planned and executed for hours on the night of October 20th, 2020, two years ago was a genocide. A wicked and bloody pogrom. A massacre we will never forget!\u201d \u00a0 \n     \n  ", "newspaper_name": "Sahara Reporters", "category": "politics", "url": "https://saharareporters.com//2022/10/21/peter-obis-running-mate-datti-portrays-northerners-barbarians-people-without-civility"},

Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo, has narrated how she was brutally raped five times. Ojo revealed this in an episode of: \"Bare it all with I Y.\" \n She stated that she was first raped at the age of 14 but refused to tell anyone because it was like taboo to be raped at that time. The actress said, \"I know a lot of ladies who have been through what I have been through. I feel it is time for me to talk to them and make them understand that it is okay to talk about it. To let them know that it is not okay to be in the situation. \"Like I said, yes I have been raped before. Not once but five times. And trust me when I say it wasn't easy. The first time I was raped, I was 14. It happened at my aunty's house (not a family member). I didn't want to talk about it because it was taboo to talk about it. I felt I would be blamed for everything that happened. \"And the second one, that was another terrible one that happened. And I still could not tell anybody in my family. I summoned a bit of courage to tell a friend of mine then and it was one of the reasons I ran away at a particular time. The whole family was looking for me and when they eventually found me, I still didn't talk about it. \"Now, the third one, the guy was a neighbour. We were very close to each other. My dad's house and his house were the second or third street away in the same neighbourhood. He was a friend to my first boyfriend, though he was much older than him.\" She added, \"I never knew that he had such an intention. I grew up in the Obanikoro area of Lagos. I moved to Ikeja to stay with my aunty. However, I went to Obanikoro sometimes to check on my grandmother, dad, and boyfriend. On my way from Obanikoro going home, I was at the bus stop waiting for a taxi, then his car drove past me and he stopped. \"We exchanged pleasantries. He asked me where I was going. I told him that I was going to Ikeja and he offered to drop me off. He said he had moved to Ikeja. When we got to Ikeja, he told me he lives in Toyin Street. I told him I know the street very well because I lived in Balogun Bus Stop in Ikeja. He said he should show me his house so that I could visit whenever I feel like it. \"I didn't see any big deal in it because he was a friend to my ex, the first boyfriend then. When we got to his house, he had a rug, air-conditioner and television in the parlour. He suddenly said he was hungry and asked me if I was hungry too. I told him that I wasn't because I was already late and my aunty would be waiting for me. \"He then said he had loved me even before Emmanuel met me and that when he found out I was going out with Emmanuel, he was heartbroken. At that time, I was almost 18 years old. He started trying to touch me. I got up angrily and made my way to the door. I noticed that it was locked. I told him to open the door. He told me that he loves me. \"Then he started dragging me. That brought back memories of the experience I had been through that first time. So, it dawned on me that it was about to happen again. I didn't want it to so I wrestled with him. I tried to push him and ran into one of the rooms to open the window to scream but he pulled me back with my hair and then he held my neck to the wall. \"I continued struggling and wrestling with him so he dragged me out of the room because he didn't want me to shout and gave me a dirty slap. I hit my head on the wall. I was a bit dizzy trying to find my feet and he went into the kitchen to get the knife. When he got the knife, his eyes went red and his face changed. \"He wasn't the same person that I knew. It dawned on me that if I fight him, I will end up dead. Then he dragged me back into the room. I was just numb. He did whatever he wanted to do. When he was done, he went out and came back and started calling my name because I was still at the spot he raped me. Then he started calling me baby. That word baby was piercing my brain because I was mad. \"You never get over it, but it gets to a stage in your life whereby it becomes a story to tell. You have to deal with it. I have been able to deal with it in my way because before, I can't talk about it. When I try to, I get so emotional, angry, and many other things come with it. \"Right now, I can talk about it. So, after the kissing, he said he loved me and I told him that I loved him too. He went to drop me off at my bus stop. While walking down home, I could remember that I was just calm. I had no feelings or emotions. I got home and luckily my aunty wasn't around. I just went straight upstairs and climbed into the bathtub and just started crying. \"I cried my heart out. Then I pondered about telling my ex-boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend was a bad boy and I wouldn't say I liked all the bad things he did. So I decided not to tell him because they might kill or do something terrible to him if I did. I didn't want that because I didn't want blood on my hands. \"I don't know if what I did was right or wrong. So, the only way not to tell him was to break up with him. Then the other one happened after I got married to my husband and had my kids, then we moved to Ikeja. I was raped by one of the armed robbers who came to our house. It's not easy to talk about rape. No matter how much you talk about it, you have to realise that it is painful, but you are not alone.\" \n     \n  ", "newspaper_name": "Sahara Reporters", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://saharareporters.com//2021/03/13/i-was-raped-five-times%E2%80%94nollywood-actress-iyabo-ojo-recalls-sexual-violence"},
