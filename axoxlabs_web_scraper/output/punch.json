This was contained in a disclaimer sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the PDP National Chairman, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu, on October 19. DAILY POST recalls that Lawal was on Monday   alongside four others by the Ogun State chapter of the PDP for \u201corganising an illegal primary.\u201d An Abeokuta Federal High Court had on September 27   earlier held by the PDP, asking the party to organise another primary within 14 days. Dissatisfied, the PDP NWC appealed the judgment, wondering how Jimi Lawal and his followers would arrogate to themselves powers of the national body of the party by writing INEC and holding the so-called primary election. \u201cWe write to draw the attention of the Commission to a purported primary election conducted by some persons claiming to be State Executive Members of our party, allegedly held on Monday, 17th October 2022, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State Capital. \u201cThis is coming days after the 14 days ordered by the Federal High Court for the party to conduct a fresh primary election. \u201cThe 14 days ordered by the Federal High Court, Abeokuta division within which the party was to conduct a fresh primary election lapsed on Tuesday, 10th October, 2022, and no fresh Primaries was conducted in Ogun State, the party having resolved to go on appeal and rightly so. \u201cThis, being our position, we were surprised to read both on print media and online media that some persons claiming to be part of a faction of the party conducted a fresh primary on behalf of the party on Monday, 17th October, 2022, 7 days after the 14 days ordered by the Federal High Court, Abeokuta division which the party appealed against has lapsed,\u201d Ayu said. In a copy of the letter acknowledged by the office of the INEC National Chairman on October 20, Ayu said, \u201cSection 50 of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party (as amended in 2017) empowers the National Working Committee acting on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) to formulate guidelines and regulations for the nomination of candidates for election into public offices at all levels and shall be the final authority for resolving all disputes relating to the choice of candidates for the party for any election and for conveying to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) or any other authority to whom it may concern, confirming the names or list of names of candidates of the party in any elective office in the federation. This section enjoys a plethora of judicial backings.\u201d In the letter co-signed by Ayu and the National Secretary of the party, Samuel Anyanwu, the party called the attention of the electoral umpire to the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022, saying, \u201cThe Act provides that all correspondences between the Commission and political parties must be signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the party and not State Executives.\u201d Ayu said: \u201cWe are by this letter, notifying the commission of this illegality and to further inform the Commission that the National Working Committee is dissociating itself from the said fresh primary election conducted by persons other than the National Working Committee. We do not recognize these persons involved in this illegality. \u201cIn view of the foregoing, the Commission is advised to refrain from accepting any letters or correspondences written on behalf of the party by any State Executive of Ogun State and should be circumspect in its dealings with these persons in the future.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/2023-pdp-chairman-ayu-disowns-jimi-lawal-says-no-fresh-primary-in-ogun/"},

The Apex Court presided over by Justice Amina Adamu Augie struck out the request following the dramatic withdrawal of a motion to that effect by Chief Paul Erokoro SAN who was counsel to Ogba. At Friday\u2019s proceedings, Erokoro, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria had attempted to argue for a prayer for the Supreme Court to review its earlier judgment which recognized Ifeanyi as the PDP governorship candidate. However, following the mood of the Court to the request, the senior lawyer beat a retreat and dramatically withdrew processes filed on behalf of his client when it became apparent that the Apex Court would not yield to the request. Following the withdrawal, Justice Amina Augie struck out the request. Before the withdrawal, counsel to Chukwuma Ifeanyi, Chief Chris Uche, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN, had vehemently opposed the request of the factional governorship candidate on the grounds that it constituted a gross abuse of the Supreme Court. Uche who led a team of senior lawyers in the matter, had prayed the court to uphold its finality policy as the highest court in the land, adding that any attempt to grant the request of Ogba will not augur well for the judiciary. The senior lawyer pleaded with the Apex Court to turn down the request on the grounds of being frivolous, unmeritorious, and a strange invitation that must not be honoured by the court. The Supreme Court had on September 14, 2022, in its final judgment in an appeal marked SC/CV/939/2022 affirmed Chukwuma Odii Ifeanyi as the authentic PDP governorship candidate having emerged from a primary election conducted by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. The court had struck out an appeal on the grounds that the issue of nomination of candidates for elective office is an internal affair of political parties and that no court has jurisdiction to entertain it. However, dissatisfied, Joseph Obinna Ogba, returned to the same court seeking a review of the September 14 judgment but was withdrawn by his counsel.", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/supreme-court-strikes-out-request-for-review-of-own-judgment-on-ebonyi-pdp-guber-ticket/"},

A banner on the building shows the images of PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and Zamfara governorship flagbearer, Dauda Lawal. In a trending video, the police team targeted a number of youths standing meters away and discharged shots. A young man was later grabbed and dragged to a pick-up truck. The video ends as officers try to put him in the vehicle; one knelt to shoot again. In reaction, some citizens accused Matawalle of giving the order. Bullets reportedly hit at least two people and their condition is unknown. On Twitter, @bekemeluo wrote: This is how they recruited Boko Haram terrorists who join Nigerian armed forces. Why is no one speaking against what\u2019s happening in Zamfara? @obutedonreal: This happened hours ago in Zamfara state. Gov Matawalle ordered police officers to shut PDP members in Atiku campaign office in Gusau. @von_Bismack: What Gov. Matawalle is doing to PDP in Zamfara is nothing short of tyrannical. This is clearly unacceptable and the fact that police are in on this tyranny is down casting. @AM_Saleem: This is not trending because it is APC! Gov Matawalle ordered police officers to shoot PDP members in Atiku/Dauda campaign office in Gusau. According to reports, 2 people were shot. @Royalty264629: If Nigerians allow the APC to continue with their oppression of the opposition by using police to close down @atiku\u2019s campaign offices in Zamfara, it means Nigerians will not be allowed to vote on election days. @abdul_donjay: This is happening in a State that\u2019s reeling with insecurity, using police to attack opposition members instead of using the personnel to fight the bandits #Zamfara. On Tuesday, the state government reiterated the ban on campaigns for the 2023 elections. Abdullahi Shinkafi, Chairman, Committee on Prosecution of Banditry and Related Offences, spoke to newsmen. Shinkafi said 80 people, including women, were in the custody of security agencies for aiding bandits. The official explained that insecurity was why the Matawalle administration stopped political gatherings. \u201cThose (terrorists) dislodged are now regrouping to attack communities as a form of revenge. \u201cThe Zamfara government is aware of their movement and is tracking them. \u201cThese are some of the reasons the government suspended political rallies and to deal with the situation,\u201d he added. Last week, Matawalle enforced Executive Order No.10 suspending 2023 activities, and locking down three local government areas \u2013 Anka, Bukuyum and Gummi. Commissioner of Information, Ibrahim Dosara said the governor took the decision \u201cfollowing the loss of lives of our fellow brothers and sisters\u201d. \u201cPolitical meetings and gatherings at individual residences are also banned with immediate effect, henceforth.\u201d Video: This happen hours again in Zamfara state Gov Matawalle order police officers to shut PDP members in Atiku campaign office in Gusau Zamfara state capital  \u2014 Mayor of Benue (@obutedonreal) ", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/matawalle-under-fire-as-police-shoot-pdp-supporters-in-zamfara-video/"},

We are Anambra people, and violence doesn\u2019t define us. Irrespective of party, we will remain brothers and sisters, and we always come together like this to support one another.\u201d The governor eulogized the deceased, saying he lived a good life, a long and impactful one too, having died at the ripe age of 83.

In Akamkpa and Biase Local Government areas, countless mining firms, as well as illegal miners prospect for natural resources, tearing open lands wantonly, but frequently do not declare what minerals they have discovered. These have often caused frictions between them and local communities who feel cheated and raped, which reason amongst others the State government banned mining activities recently. Speaking on behalf of other affected traditional chieftains of other neighbouring communities, the clan head of Akpet Central in Biase LGA of the State, Adolphus Sunday Evong said miners should no longer ill-treat mining host communities as if they did not matter, or take them for fools. In an interview on the sideline of the workshop organised by the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office in the federal ministry of mines and steel development, for stakeholders in the South-South on the adoption of the electronic mining Cadastre System, the clan head said, \u201cThe situation where they exploit our resources and leave us bare, we are not going to accept such deprivations any longer.\u201d Expressing unhappiness, Evong said, \u201cThe natural resources they mine from our communities were given to us by God. So, they must carry the people along. \u201cThe host communities should also enjoy what comes out from their lands. The poverty level in my community, for instance, is very high. So a situation where miners come and extract resources, enrich themselves without commensurate compensations is not fair at all, and not acceptable any more.\u201d According to him, they have nothing to show from the extraction of natural resources from their lands. He said, \u201cWe have no light, no water, no decent houses, no roads. Yet they are basking in opulence from our resources; building mansions here and everywhere. Should we continue to allow that? \u201cAnother thing that has made us very angry and it is very painful, too, is that these miners hardly declare what types of mineral resources they have discovered on our lands. \u201cThey will continue to exploit and extract and make fortunes, leaving us in abject poverty. \u201cHenceforth, we want to know the type of minerals they have discovered from our lands. We want the miners to give host communities good percentages of the resources they mine so that we can use such to develop our communities.\u201d Reacting, a Chief Executive Officer of a mining firm in the State, Lady Diamond Sekibo insisted that as licensed miners they do declare what minerals they prospect for, and hoped that ongoing meetings with the authorities to resolve many issues will be worthwhile. \u201cAs licensed miners, we are by law bound to declare the types of mineral resources we discover in any given community. It should be noted that the types of minerals to be mined are usually listed on one\u2019s licence. \u201cIt is the illegal miners that indulge in covering up what they have discovered from their prospecting,\u201d she said. She lamented that they are facing huge challenges, among which is multiple taxation. \u201cWe do not even know where they are all coming from. We sincerely hope that the government will look into them with a view to streamlining them. \nMany of us have been badly affected by the recent order by the State Government banning mining activities in the State. \u201cWe are happy that we are resolving the issues with the government, so as to avoid further losses,\u201d she added.", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/cross-river-community-leaders-battle-mining-firms-over-undeclared-prospects/"},

He advised the people of the vulnerable areas to cooperate with one another and the police to quickly put an end to all security issues in the areas. Recall that four kidnap incidents were recorded in the areas recently, leading to the abduction of some persons, including two children of the same parent, with the kidnappers demanding N8m ransom for their release. The meeting, which had in attendance, Ardos and Serkis, was summoned as part of the efforts by the police to tackle incidences of kidnapping and other criminality in Kwara State.

While responding, the chairman Baruteen Ardo Alhaji Hassan, who led the Fulani from Baruteen axis assured the CP of the readiness of the Fulani vigilante to work with the police but requested that enough protection be availed his people and diligent prosecution of any arrested suspect assured, as he abhors a situation where a suspect arrested and handed over to the police and within two or three days after, the same arrested suspect is back in the village walking confidently and posing a threat to the people should be avoided.

DAILY POST reports that a father of three children recently cried out over their abduction by kidnappers in the Gaa Osibi area. The kidnappers demanded N8m ransom for their freedom. Ayuba Lukuman Biodun said one of the children was luckily rescued by a vigilante group but the remaining two children are still in captivity with the kidnappers. He said the N2m he was able to raise after selling his Toyota Camry car for N1.5m was rejected by the kidnappers who insisted that the N8m ransom demanded must be completed before they could release the children or he risked losing them. The President of Ibagun Progressive Union (IPU), Alh Kuranga Omomeji Morogun, who appealed to concerned authorities over the incident in a statement issued in Ilorin, expressed the concern of the people of Ibagun-Okelele community over the spate of abduction of residents of Alubarika, Aleniboro and communities, all in Ilorin South Local Government Area of the State. He said the fear of his people stemmed from the fact that the Ibagun-Okelele community shares borders with the troubled communities. While acknowledging the concerted efforts of the State government and the security agencies in nipping kidnapping and other acts of criminality in the bud across the length and breadth of the State, Omomeji urged them not to rest on their oars until the State is totally rid of criminal elements. Omomeji also urged the people of the community to remain vigilant and promptly report suspicious movements to the appropriate quarters. He sympathised with the people of Alagbado communities over the recent attacks launched against them by the kidnappers. It will be recalled that no fewer than four cases of abduction took place in Gaa-Osibi, Alagbado communities, in quick succession, in recent times. Two adults were reportedly killed by the kidnappers, while five children, three of whom are of the same parent, were abducted by the gunmen. The situation has forced the residents of the troubled communities to abandon their homes and seek shelter elsewhere.", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/residents-cry-out-desert-homes-over-rampaging-kidnappers-in-ilorin/"},

{"headline": "Flood: Devastation persists, victims count losses in Anambra", "image_url": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Anambra.jpeg", "author": "Joe Chukindi", "posted_date": "2022-10-21", "description": "The 2022 flood disaster in Anambra and some other States in Nigeria is no doubt one too many. In previous years, after two weeks, the flood usually recedes, giving victims who may have relocated to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps the opportunity to move back to their homes. This year\u2019s flooding which began in Anambra one month ago has not shown any sign of receding, just as more homes are being submerged on a daily basis, swelling the number of victims who are relocating to IDPs camps daily. A recent visit to two IDPs camps in Anambra East Local Government Area showed the level of pain most of the victims were undergoing. In Umuoba Anam, hundreds of people were seen living in a hall, owned by a school. While some had mattresses to sleep on, many others, especially women and children, used pieces of clothes spread on the floor. A flood victim, who spoke to journalists; Mr Emmanuel Okonkwor said: \u201cI am saddened over the condition of the victims here. They lay on bare floor, and most of them are yet to receive anything from the government except what some individuals brought. They also need money to buy condiments, kerosene and firewood to make the food which people eat once a day.\u201d In Mmiata Anam, Mrs Tina Okeke said she has been sleeping on the floor with her six children since the flood set in and forced them to relocate to the camp, while also saying that hunger has been a major challenge to them. Meanwhile, the high number of deaths in the flood prone areas has been attributed to the unwillingness of most rural farmers to leave their farms. A farmer in the area, David Ogbonna, who spoke to DAILY POST during a visit to the flood prone area said: \u201cYou won\u2019t understand, but it is difficult to just enter the boat and be taken to upland areas, when you know that you have a house, and properties that you will be leaving behind. \u201cSometimes, these government people just provide a boat to rescue you, but the truth is that we consider the things we are leaving behind. Sometimes, when you leave and water recedes, thieves may raid your house, even your crops in the farm.\u201d Offering another perspective, a candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Mrs Peace Obimuonso said the human casualty being experienced as a result of the flood could have been averted if the people were guaranteed of a good camp with amenities, food, water and other basic needs. \u201cAll these deaths could have been averted if the people were sure of the source of their next meal. Most times, the farmers borrow money from local money lenders, which if they fail to pay back when due, attracts heavy consequences. But because they know that leaving their homes and going to live as refugees in camps was not the best, they now stay back to see what they can salvage of their crops.\u201d DAILY POST, however, gathered that efforts were in top gear by farmers in Omor, Ayamelum Local Government Area, to rescue their crops from flood. Mr Ejike Sunday, who spoke to our correspondent in Awka said: \u201cI\u2019m going to the village. We have a meeting, and we hope to commence an operation to rescue our crops. The Government doesn\u2019t know what our people go through when a flood comes. They just hope that you will quickly move to IDPs camps, but our people are basically farmers. The crops we have spent time, energy and money growing will be underwater. It is hard to leave. \u201cSome people took loans to farm for the year, what will you tell the lenders? So, there is a meeting in the village to see how we can rescue some crops. The tendency is that most farm produce may be harvested earlier than normal, to avoid being further destroyed by flood.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "DailyPost Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2022/10/21/flood-devastation-persists-victims-count-losses-in-anambra/"},

Hours later, the police told the public that minimal force was used to   who had gathered for the memorial procession. On October 27, 2020, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army (NA) said the Lagos government   to intervene during the October 20 protests. The Army revealed that this was after a curfew was imposed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Brig. Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, then Commander, 81 Military Intelligence Brigade in Victoria Island, appeared before the Lagos Judicial Panel. Taiwo told the commission that hoodlums had taken over the metropolis and overran police teams across the state. The General said the scenes of the carnage that followed the toll gate shooting were reminiscent of the Liberian Civil War. \u201cIt was these incidents that made the Governor of Lagos State to ask for military intervention. \u201cIn my opinion, that was the correct thing to do since the police had been overrun and policemen were fighting for their dear lives\u201d, Taiwo noted.
