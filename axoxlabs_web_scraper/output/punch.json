He said they were trying to cross over to the Yenebelebiri community to check the level of devastation of their houses and farmlands by the flood when the unfortunate incident occurred.  Meanwhile, the organisers of the Prosperity Cup, led by its Director-General, Ono Akpe, have commiserated with the family of the late Peremobowei and described his demise as a sad tale for the football community in Bayelsa and Nigeria in general.\n Akoe said, \u201cThis is really sad for me. Ernest was a very good player. We saw his exploits at the last Prosperity Cup, where he scored nine goals. \u201cEven at the finals of the FA Cup against Bayelsa United, he scored a beautiful goal.

The fact that he saved five persons before succumbing to the raging torrents is indeed quite unfortunate.\n \u201cOn behalf of the organisers, I sympathize with the family, his teammates, the football community, the sports ministry, the state government, and all those who knew him in anyway.

According to him, the delay in the implementation of the presidential intervention towards the emergency in Bayelsa had continued to reinforce the feeling of neglect by the Federal Government among the flood victims.\n Iselema, who led officials of the committee on a routine inspection of the camps, said: \u201cWe need Federal Government\u2019s urgent intervention.\n \u201cWhatever we are doing here (at Oxbow Lake IDPs camp) is being replicated at the Igbogene camp and other camps.

The candidate, who went on the visit with his running mate and Nollywood actor, Olufunke Akindele, called for the support of the royal fathers and people in the division, saying that they had suffered enough.\n According to him, his administration would bring development to Badagry, construct bridges and make the division a destination for investors.\n He said, \u201cI want to congratulate you this time around because ever since the return of democracy no one considered Badagry Division for the governorship seat in Lagos State. That I got the PDP ticket is predestinated by God. \u201cI want to thank you for standing by us and for your prayers. I want to congratulate this division, especially my fathers that in Lagos it is the turn of Badagry royal fathers. It is good luck to Badagry.\n \u201cI was trained in this house and my fathers and mothers are here today. It is our turn to serve. I have not come to play politics, but to seek your blessings.\n \u201cYou are the fathers of all and we have come to seek your blessings. We are not at war with anybody and our government would be for the masses.\u201d\n Adediran told the Obas that his team had decided to tour all the wards in the state and that it was the turn of Badagry.\n He decried the state of the roads in the division saying that he would not be in government and the situation would remain the same.\n \u201cWe are going to have Coconut Island in Badagry just as we have Banana Island. We will construct bridges in the division,\u201d he said.\n He advised the division to vote for all the candidates of the PDP in the general elections slated for February 25, 2023, and March 11, 2023. Adediran, while addressing the teeming party\u2019s supporters at the palace said that his team had prepared to run a humane government that would prioritise the masses\u2019 interests.\n Also commenting, Akindele told the traditional rulers that she joined Jandor to give hope to women, children, and the youths in the state.\n She said, \u201cI am promising you that I will do you proud, I will not disappoint you.\u201d\n Speaking on behalf of the traditional rulers in the division at the palace, the Oniworo of Iworo Kingdom, Oba Oladele Kosoko said, \u201cOnly a child will not know what Badagry Division is going through.\n \u201cWhoever God has chosen to help our division will get there.\u00a0 We as fathers will continue to pray for you,\u201d he said.  He urged the politicians to campaign based on issues and avoid violence.\n Speaking at wards G and F in Badagry Local Government Area in Ajido, Adediran said that God had written it that a time was coming that a son of the soil would be the next governor and that He had chosen someone from the riverine area. He stated that they had been supporting people from other places to be governors in Lagos State, but the time had come that it should no longer be given to just anybody.\n \u201cWe have been going everywhere, we were in Alimosho for three days. It is time for the son of the soil to do it. No matter what happens we will see some of us who want the status quo to remain. But we will not fight them.\n \u201cJust call them to one side and discuss with them, you will discover that they are selfish because they are the ones benefitting from a government that does not care for the people.\n \u201cWe want to have a government of the masses. I used to travel on the water with my mother and I am used to this place, so I want to develop it.\u00a0We want to appeal to our traditional rulers to help us. Some of these people would come with money and the money is to take away your rights.\n \u201cAre you still spending the money they gave you four years ago? You can see the difference between the Baales here and those in the city,\u201d he said.\n Adediran further urged the youths to talk to their friends, including those in the APC, and let them know that it was time for the son of the soil to take over.\n He added that the likes of top politicians in the area such as Hon. Sunny Ajose and others in the APC and the PDP would be recognised in his government. According to him, people could be in another party but they would vote for him as their son.\n He said, \u201cAll the deputy governors and APC party chairmen that they have been giving us what have they achieved?\u00a0 I can tell you that even the Chairman of the APC in Lagos State, Pst. Cornelius Ojelabi, would vote for the PDP in 2023. I told him before I started the race. When I become the governor I would take care of him.\n \u201cI am not going to be a PDP or APC governor, I would be the governor of all. Since they have been ruling they have not been able to complete Badagry Expressway unlike what they did in Lekki.\n \u201cWhen we get into office, we will construct bridges in Badagry. Don\u2019t be afraid, it is just eight hours on election day and they cannot rig this election. We have been winning them in Badagry Division all along.\u201d\n Speaking earlier,\u00a0 Akindele urged the people to continue working and not to be tired, while expressing satisfaction with the reception given to them.\n \u201cI am happy with the way you welcomed us, you are too much.\u00a0We are ready for a better life in Lagos from May 29, 2023, when Jandor would assume office.\n \u201cThey have given women a chance and as deputy governor, we will give people soft loans and there will be free education for our children. We will get local tailors to sew school uniforms for our children so they can also make money,\u201d she said. The program was attended by Baales and traditional chiefs, including the Oba Kosoko of Iworo Kingdom, Oba of the Ajido Kingdom, who were represented, Baale of Jegene, Chief Sumaila Lukmon and Baale of Jegenu Ayaba, Chief Fasasi Shittu, party members and residents of the area.\n The campaign team also visited the popular Agbalata Market and other major markets in Badagry to seek the support of traders and business owners.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://punchng.com/my-emergence-destined-by-god-jandor/"},

Ten Hag\u2019s decision to lay down the law to Ronaldo could signal the beginning of the end for the Portugal attacker in his second spell with United.\n It would be no surprise if United and Ronaldo parted ways in the January transfer window, but Ten Hag\u2019s men did not appear troubled by the striker\u2019s latest petulant outburst.\n With Ronaldo banished, United were still the stronger side for long periods, while there were no chants in support of the 37-year-old from the visiting fans packed into one corner of Stamford Bridge. Fifth placed United remain one point behind fourth placed Chelsea, who are unbeaten in eight matches in all competitions since Graham Potter replaced the sacked Thomas Tuchel.\n The only concern for United was the sight of France centre-back Raphael Varane limping off in tears in the second half after a World Cup injury scare.\n Varane\u2019s leg twisted awkwardly as he stretched in a failed attempt to intercept a pass towards Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, leaving him crumpled in a heap on the pitch for several minutes.\n The 29-year-old was eventually able to walk around the pitch unaided, but his angst at potentially missing the World Cup, which starts on November 20, was clear as he punched the corner flag in frustration.\n Lost in the fuss over Ronaldo\u2019s antics was the vibrancy of United\u2019s performance against Tottenham and they retained that quality at the Bridge.\n A flurry of passes cut through Chelsea\u2019s midfield to create the first chance for Luke Shaw, who fizzed his low drive just wide of the far post from the edge of the area.  Teed up by Bruno Fernandes, United winger Anthony was next to threaten with a left-foot curler that forced a good save from Kepa Arrizabalaga. Marcus Rashford\u2019s return to form has played a role in keeping Ronaldo on the bench this season.\n However, Ronaldo would surely have delivered a better finish than Rashford managed midway through the first half.\n Fernandes\u2019s pin-point pass opened up the Chelsea defence, leaving Rashford one-on-one with Kepa but a poor first touch took him away from goal and his shot thudded into the Chelsea keeper\u2019s chest.\n Rashford didn\u2019t let that mess drain his confidence and he surged into the Chelsea area for a fierce strike that Kepa palmed away.\n With Chelsea being over-run in central areas, Potter responded by replacing centre-back Marc Cucurella and sending on midfielder Mateo Kovacic in a bid to disrupt United\u2019s rhythm.\n Chelsea finally managed a menacing raid after Kovacic\u2019s introduction as Aubameyang stabbed just wide.\n Aubameyang couldn\u2019t get the decisive touch to a pair of half-chances moments later but United were unfazed. Christian Eriksen flashed narrowly wide from 25 yards before Anthony missed a glorious chance, the winger firing wide after Fernandes sent him racing clear on goal.\n Chelsea\u2019s Trevoh Chalobah hit the bar with a second half header from Mason Mount\u2019s cross.\n And Potter\u2019s men looked to have won it in when Scott McTominay needlessly fouled Armando Broja and Jorginho calmly slotted past David De Gea.\n But four minutes into stoppage-time, Casemiro rose highest for a superb header that Kepa could only tip onto the post, the ball bouncing down just over the line to spark wild United celebrations.\n AFP", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/casemiros-goal-rescues-man-united-in-chelsea-draw/"},

See you December 3rd, London!\u201d.\n The plan is to use the fight with Chisora, 38, to tune up for a proposed unification bout with Oleksandr Usyk, who beat Joshua for the second time in August. The Ukrainian, who holds the IBF, WBA and WBO titles, previously indicated he had no desire to fight until next year.\n The December contest does not have the allure of a blue-riband showdown with Joshua but Fury praised Chisora, who lost a points decision to Usyk in October 2020, for coming forward.\n \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sell this fight,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cI have offered the big guys the fights and they don\u2019t want the smoke. \u201cI rate Chisora as highly as I do Usyk, so I will train like he is the hardest fight in the world.\n \u201cHis style has changed but so has mine.

Over the years, there have been multiple attempts to make it happen, however, the fight is yet to come to fruition. Finkel is hoping to change that and has expressed a great deal of interest in the exciting alternative.\n \u201cWe said at the press conference it depends what surfaces this week. Whether it be Oleksandr Usyk, or (Eddie) Hearn reaching out. It\u2019s funny with Eddie, he made all these big statements before, \u2018Oh, I tried and I tried, Shelly doesn\u2019t want to talk to me\u2019,\u201d Finkel told    \u201cI said I would talk to him, but after the fight, because that is when it makes sense, that is what the reality is. I always said, there was no reason to have spoken before the fight, but we\u2019re always willing to talk to him. \u201cI was asked if they offered the right deal, would we do the fight in the UK? Of course. Financially, it could be Saudi Arabia or another country, but it really comes down to them. I believe the fight between Deontay and Joshua will do 80,000 at Wembley.\n \u201cTwo or three years ago, when Joshua and us did not make the fight, he had options and he was on top of the world. Right now, he doesn\u2019t have many options and if Fury fights Usyk, the only real big fight out there for Joshua is us. But it\u2019s up to them.\n \u201cThe important thing, without getting into a big dialogue with Eddie, was to wait until after the fight and then decide. If Deontay lost, there would be no fight, but now we\u2019ll see, the fight is as enormous as ever.\n \u201cIdeally (Wilder should) come back in the spring, like March. The preference would be probably Usyk, Joshua or Ruiz. And then some scenario whoever the first fight was, then the second fight we\u2019d do that, I wouldn\u2019t assume three fights but two.\u201d\n Nigerians have warned Joshua against facing Wilder, following rumours of the potential bout, as fans believe the British -Nigerian doesn\u2019t stand a chance against the American, who claimed to have traced his roots to Edo State.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/finkel-tips-wilder-joshua-fight-to-sell-out/"},

However the Catalans played their way into the game as De Jong pulled the strings, and with Lewandowski up front, goals are never far away.\n Just after the half-hour mark Jordi Alba guided Pedri\u2019s finely-weighted pass to Lewandowski, whose turn sent two defenders flying out of the picture, and a third flung himself in vain to try and block as the Poland international fired home.\n Lewandowski won an award for his scoring exploits on Monday at the Paris gala too, and combined with Kopa Trophy winner Gavi for the second goal.  After being fed by the 18-year-old, voted the best under-21 player in the world, Lewandowski took his time on the edge of the box before arcing a superb strike out of Geronimo Rulli\u2019s reach and into the net.\n The third was quick to follow, with Ferran Torres setting up Fati, who hit the post with his first attempt but flicked the rebound home from virtually on the goal-line.\n Villarreal had let in three goals in their first nine games, then three more goals in an eight-minute spell at Camp Nou, as Barcelona offered a riposte to their critics.

The former Liverpool and England star was expected to push Villa higher up the table this season, but instead he leaves with the club firmly embroiled in a relegation battle.\n Gerrard won the Scottish title with Rangers in 2021, ending Celtic\u2019s long period of dominance.\n But he has been unable to build on that impressive work since moving to Villa Park, failing to win over the club\u2019s supporters with some lacklustre performances.\n Despite being given significant transfer backing, including a swoop for Barcelona\u2019s Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho, Gerrard was unable to deliver the \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d that Villa chief executive Christian Purslow demanded.\n Gerrard was also hit by injuries to summer signings Diego Carlos and Boubacar Kamara, as well as left-back Lucas Digne.\n Speaking at his post-match press conference after the Fulham game, Gerrard had vowed to save his job.\n \u201cI\u2019m a fighter, I will never, ever quit anything whether it\u2019s football or in life. We will see what happens. I\u2019ll continued to fight unless I\u2019m told differently,\u201d he said. But just minutes after Gerrard had spoken to the media, Villa announced his sacking.\n Gerrard won just 13 of his 40 games in charge of Villa, losing 19 of those matches.\n It is a major blow to Gerrard\u2019s managerial career after the Liverpool legend was tipped as a potential long-term successor to current Reds boss Jurgen Klopp following his success with Rangers.\n Now Gerrard must bide his time as he waits for an opportunity to rehabilitate a reputation tarnished by his disappointing spell with Villa.\n Villa, owned by billionaires Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, are reportedly prepared to pay one of the highest salaries in the Premier League to land a top replacement for Gerrard.\n Former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with the post, along with ex-Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel.\n Whether Pochettino or Tuchel could be persuaded to join a club in Villa\u2019s perilous position remains to be seen. Other contenders could include Villarreal coach Unai Emery, who had Premier League experience with Arsenal, and former Burnley boss Sean Dyche, a veteran of numerous relegation battles with the Clarets.\n Villa midfielder John McGinn insisted Gerrard wasn\u2019t to blame for the team\u2019s plight.\n \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to be part of.

It stated that despite an economic rebound in 2021, the fallout from the pandemic has kept domestic economic activity in the region relatively muted, and it expects growth to slow this year.\n The Washington-based lender stated that unlike richer countries in other regions, most countries in the region lack the needed resources to support and stimulate growth.\n Listing some of the causes of the region\u2019s inflation, it said inflation in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries was being driven less by economic activity and more by external developments. It said, \u201cThey include the sharp spike in global commodity prices, swings in the exchange rate, global supply chain disruptions, and natural disasters.  \u201cIn the case of food, the prices of key staples such as maize and wheat have increased since 2019, contributing two-thirds of overall inflation in fragile states and one-half elsewhere in the region. Higher global energy prices and the strong dollar have also fed through to inflation indirectly, via transportation and tradable goods like household products.\n \u201cBy contrast, there have been only modest increases for the prices of goods and services that most reflect domestic demand pressures, so-called nontradables\u2014which typically include any locally-produced services, such as in the hospitality, health, or education sectors.\u201d\n The IMF further said it expects 12 per cent of the population in Nigeria and other countries in the sub-Saharan region to experience acute food insecurity by the end of 2022.\n It added that many countries have turned to subsidies and tax cuts to alleviate the squeeze in household incomes in a bid to alleviate some of the economic concerns of the regions while central banks across the region have started raising interest rates in response to rising inflation, capital outflows, and currency depreciation.\n It disclosed, \u201cExamples include Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda, and the economic and monetary unions for both Central and West Africa.\n \u201cMonetary authorities also find themselves facing an increasingly delicate trade-off: raising rates to keep inflation in check will risk choking off credit for investment, depressing economic activity, and reducing incomes. Meanwhile, fiscal consolidation and the global slowdown weigh on domestic economic activity.\u201d However, the IMF warned central banks against raising interest rates in a hurry as it might jeopardize recovery.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/inflation-nigeria-others-risk-political-instability-says-imf/"},

He said, \u201cThe FCT budget has two components. One is yearly allocation from 1% of the Federal Government share of the federation account and the second one is internally generated revenue which has over the years been the main sustenance of governmental operations in FCT.\n \u201cIn the N607.9bn 2022 budget of FCT, the federal allocation is just N59billion out of which only N19bn has been released.\n \u201cFor the 2023 fiscal year, the projected federal allocation has been drastically slashed to N13.5bn despite the increase in the number of planned projects from 20 in the 2022 fiscal year to 22 in the 2023 fiscal year.\u201d He explained that out of the proposed N607.9bn 2022 budget, N76.6bn was for personnel cost, N138bn for overhead cost and the remaining balance of N393.2bn for capital projects.\n According to him, one of the critical projects the capital votes are to be used on is the Greater Abuja Water Project, planned to provide portable water for 29 additional districts within the territory; rehabilitation and expansion of outer southern expressway; expansion and extension of inner southern expressway; construction of southern parkway from Christian Centre, B6 812; reconstruction and dualisation of lower Usuma Dam-Gurara road; construction of access roads for Abuja Light Rail Stations; resurfacing of existing roads and provision of emergency works in the FCT, among others.\n The construction of the 14km Mpape-Shere Galuwyi road, a bold initiative of the administration, is to ensure the successful resettlement of original inhabitants in about 16 communities. The resettlement site covers about 900 hectares of land in Bwari Area Council, to resettle the 16 villages namely: Utako, Maje, Mabushi, Jabi Samuel, Jabi Yakubu, Kpaadna, Zhilu, Gishini, Dakibiyu, Gwarimpa, Galadima, Jahi & II Kado, Bimiko, Kado Kuchi and Lungu presently domiciled within phases II and III of the city.\n He said as a result of huge financial demands, the territory was now adopting integration of indigenes into newly opened districts as against the resettlement policy that had been causing crisis over the years.\n \u201cSystem of re-settlement earlier put in place has not worked, making us adopt the policy of integration as presently being done in Kabusa,\u201d he said.\n On security, Bello disclosed to the committee members that 60 vehicles worth N2bn would be distributed to various security agencies like the Nigeria Police Force, the Army, civil defence and other security outlets by next week Thursday.  Other members of the committee who commented, tasked the minister to come up with a framework for the regulation of the public transportation system within the territory as well as the provision of required infrastructure in satellite areas, set for oversight visitation on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. However, the committee led by its chairman, Senator Smart Adeyemi ( APC Kogi West), tasked the minister to start implementation of property tax in FCT for required revenue generation.\n Adeyemi said implementation of property tax in FCT would not only give the administration, N200bn to N250bn in a year, but also help in preventing crime and criminality within the territory.\n He said, \u201cIt is only in Nigeria that people are allowed to build houses or estates without renting them out for many years, which invariably serve as hideouts for criminally minded ones.\n \u201cWith the enforcement of payment of property tax, such practice will stop,\u201d he said.\n The committee chairman noted that Abuja was like other places in the other world because when people from the international community come around for conferences, they most times extend their stay.\n Adeyemi noted that it was not about how long they had to work but what they could achieve in the few months left for the administration to end.\n He said, \u201cI also want to commend the vice chairman of this committee, Senator Tolu Odebiyi, who was the acting chairman then, he really did well. I had the privilege of attending some of their oversight I was impressed to see that a lot has been done. \u201cIt is not how long, but how well. We can still achieve a lot within this short period of time. We will make effort to see that the ongoing projects are completed.\n \u201cA lot has been said about this budget coming in late, but there is a provision that says that you can utilise about 50% if the projects expressed a challenge.

And this rests on the shoulders of not only the regulators, but on all stakeholders.\u201d\n He noted that the oil and gas industry had for several decades maintained a pride of place at the top of the global energy mix despite the threat posed by renewables and cleaner energy sources.\n \u201cHowever, recent concerns about global warming, exponential improvement in the efficiency of renewable energy alternatives and the policies of oil pricing, have combined to pose almost an existential threat to the global petroleum industry,\u201d he stated.\n The NMDPRA boss added, \u201cThe threats of renewable energy sources, which in the past were almost dismissed by energy industry experts, have today become more real than ever.\n \u201cAnd I will like to draw your attention to a few of the more recent trends. Three among the biggest technology companies have made attempts at electric cars to replace gasoline and diesel engines.\n \u201cWhile the attempt of Apple may not have made it to production yet, and that of Google was suspended after clearly successful street trials, that of Tesla took the world by surprise.\u201d\n Ahmed noted that not only did the first two releases of Tesla out-performed sales forecast, they were also oversubscribed and the demand kept rising, while new models were being added.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/weve-lost-our-most-valued-crude-oil-customers-fg/"},

Dangote said, \u201cFor the textile industry, I believe the government should draft legislation in the National Assembly that states that anyone selling prohibited foreign textiles must face prison time without the option of a fine. So it\u2019ll just be going to jail, even if it\u2019s only for two years.\n \u201cThe real issue in the textile industry is not a lack of less expensive power. The textile will not last if you give them cheaper power but allow the smuggling to continue.  \u201cWhat is happening is that foreign companies are dumping their products in Nigeria. That is why I dislike importing. When you import, you are importing poverty while exporting prosperity and job opportunities. \u201cToday people would be sent to jail in India for selling foreign textiles anywhere. Also, if something is banned in the United States of America for example, there is no way it could be displayed for sale in a shop.\n \u201cBut what is stopping the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s government policies is the absence of the political will to make sure that we implement those policies no matter who is going to be upset by us.\n \u201cIf we have a prosperous environment the insecurity will drop.\u201d\n Recall that in 2019, The Central Bank of Nigeria placed access to foreign exchange for all forms of textile materials on the FOREX restriction list to revive the industry, a step that has had almost no effect as the National Bureau of Statistics recorded in its trade report that textiles and textile articles increased by 257.9 per cent in the first three months of 2021 to N171.8bn from N48bn in 2020.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/dangote-demands-arrest-of-foreign-textile-materials-importers/"},

However, economic experts have attributed the major cause of the falling reserves to forex interventions deployed by the apex bank to address the forex crisis in the aviation sector, and the continuous injection of foreign exchange to defend the naira value.\n The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Cowry Asset Management Limited, Mr Johnson Chukwu, noted that there was shortage of dollar inflow in the economy.\n \u201cThere is low dollar inflow, and what the CBN has, it is using it to defend the naira,\u201d he said. A professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo and the Chairman of the Foundation for Economic Research and Training, Prof. Akpan Ekpo, recalled how the CBN intervened in the aviation forex crisis.  He said, \u201cOne of the major needs that the reserves was used to meet is the airlines. If you recall, the airlines were shutting down. The reserved were also used for normal settlements of other obligations.\u201d\n The Central Bank of Nigeria had announced the released $265m to airlines operating in the country, to settle outstanding ticket sales to check crisis in the country\u2019s aviation sector.\n There had been serious concerns and reactions over the inability of foreign airlines operating to repatriate over $450m ticket sales proceeds out of the country, fuelling concerns over investors perception about Nigeria.\n International airlines operating in the country had raised airfares and cut flights over their inability to repatriate funds to their home countries.\n Some airlines also threatened the suspension of their flight operations in the country.\n According to the CBN, the breakdown of the aviation intervention indicated that $230m was released as special foreign exchange intervention while another $35m was released through Retail SMIS auction The Governor, CBN, Godwin Emefiele, launched the \u2018RT200 FX Programme\u2019 earlier in the year to boost forex supply in the country through the non-oil sector in the next three to five years.\n \u00a0\u201cThe RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us attain our lofty yet attainable goal of $200bn in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next three to five years,\u201d he said.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/external-reserves-lose-1-2bn-amid-rising-dollar-demand/"},

He said, \u201cWe have not seen anything Nigerian in this Nigeria Air. It is a camouflage of interest. The decision to set up a national carrier in partnership with Ethiopian Airlines is a policy somersault. The people in government have continued to demonise the local operators. Aviation companies have collapsed in other parts of the world, not only in Nigeria. What the aviation sector needs is support. The private sector will collapse with this (national carrier) arrangement. Nigeria will be losing much. It must not be allowed to be sustained. There is nothing Nigeria in this Nigerian Air.\u201d\n This came as other aviation stakeholders including pilots, aircraft engineers and aviation business experts who spoke at the webinar rejected the proposed Nigeria Air, saying its shareholding structure was absurd and could plunge the aviation industry into further chaos.\n The Managing Director of Top Brazz Aviation and former Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, Roland Iyayi, said the proposed national airline would help Ethiopian Airlines to achieve its domination of the African market, adding that the Ethiopian national carrier had formed similar agreements in eight other African countries. He said, \u201cThis approach will decimate the local market. Agreement with Ethiopian Airlines will create cabotage. Ethiopian Airlines will come into our domestic market, lower fares (non-competitive fares) with the aim of taking over the market. The choice of Ethiopian Airlines will destroy our industry. We reject this totally.\u201d\n Iyayi, who is also a pilot, further said, \u201cIn anticipation of the Single African Air Transport Market, Ethiopian Airlines want to dominate the African market. The government is meant to support local carriers. Ethiopian Airlines has partnerships in eight other countries in Africa.\n \u201cET currently has 135 planes. The CEO of the airline has said its plan to increase their fleet to 250 planes in the next five years. The intent is to go into the domestic market of all the African countries where they have footprints. This is simply aviation colonialism. If we take all of this onboard, you will wonder whether the government has the interest of Nigerian airlines at heart or not.\u201d\n Also speaking, President, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Nigeria, Mr Alex Nwuba, said with Ethiopian Airlines having 49 per cent stake in the proposed national carrier, it would be difficult for Nigerian Air to fly intercontinental routes.\n Nwuba, a former managing director of Associated Airlines and a pilot, said, \u201cWe do not think this is the best thing happening. It is not genuine. We reject it. Nigeria Air will not suffer any fate different from what befell the defunct Virgin Nigeria that could not go to the United States. This is clear in the Bilateral Air Services Agreement regulations.\u201d\n The aviation expert also queried why MRS and SAHCOL, listed as private investors in the proposed national carrier, had yet to inform their shareholders via the capital market their decision to invest in Nigeria Air.\n \u201cMRS and SAHCOL have yet to put up statements at the capital market to inform shareholders that they will be putting some money in the national airline. This is unethical,\u201d he added. An aviation expert and aeronautical engineer, Babatunde Adeniji, also faulted the shareholding structure of the carrier, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t share the sentiment; the arrangement is such that you are using government funds to bring a competitor that will distort the market. We need to create a level-playing field. How can we make the industry sustainable? There is a need for transparency in the whole process of setting up a national carrier.\u201d  The Principal Manager, Avaero Capital, Sindy Foster, also queried the transparency and shareholding structure of Nigeria Air.\n She noted, \u201cThe local carriers are not being supported. Aviation fuel issues and forex access problems which affect their capacity to maintain aircraft are not addressed. Everywhere, we talk about the poor performance of Nigerian airlines but we do not support them. We need to support them to grow.\u2019\u2019\n According to the Chief Executive Officer, West Link Airlines, Capt Ibrahim Mshelia, Nigeria has the capacity to establish its own national carrier without a foreign airline.\n He said, \u201cThis proposed national carrier should be stopped. The entity called national carrier is just a game to get what is touted as a national carrier owned by individuals. We have the capacity to establish our airlines. We should not allow ET to do it. Let an Ethiopian investor do it. The deal should be cancelled. It is an insult to our sensibility. We can develop our aviation sector. Some people just want to form a private carrier under the name of a national carrier.\u201d\n On his part, Head, Research, Zenith Travels, Olumide Ohunayo, wondered why the government had yet to be transparent about the deal.\n \u201cThere are vested interests in what is being touted as a national carrier. We should not skew it in favour of some interests. If we must have the national carrier at all, then we should do in a manner that will be a level-playing field.\u201d In his contribution at the webinar, an aviation expert, Simon Tumba, said, \u201cHow can Nigerian Air consolidate the Nigerian market, African market and then the intercontinental market with this kind of arrangement? This project has personal interest. Every Nigerian must reject it. It shows that the project itself has issues. The private sector entities that have shown interest in Nigeria Air have yet to report this at the capital market. It is unethical\u201d\n A former Acting Director-General, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Benedict Adeyileka, said, \u201cNobody has mentioned the interest of Nigerian professionals. We have local operators that can operate. I am completely against Ethiopia Airlines as a partner, while I am in support of the establishment of a national carrier.\u201d\n Also, the Chief Executive Officer, Sabre Network, an airline global distribution network, Gabriel Olowo, said the government should simply remove \u2018national\u2019 and call its deal with Ethiopian Airlines a flag carrier.\n Olowo added, \u201cIn aero-politics, how much support does the Nigerian government give our carriers to go on foreign routes? There is nothing national about the so-called national carrier. They should remove the word national carrier and call it a flag carrier, and then create a level-playing field for everyone to compete.\u201d\n Also speaking, a former Military Commandant of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Group Capt John Ojikutu (retd), said, \u201cWe have tried in the past to have national carriers but failed. We should simply reduce multiple designations to foreign airlines and create more markets for domestic airlines. We need just two flag carriers.\u201d\n Aviation industry analyst, Mr Wole Shadare, however insisted that there was a need to give the government a chance to promote the deal, advising the Ministry of Aviation to review its plan.\n An aide to the Ministry of Aviation, Mr James Odaudu, said that the government was on course to set up the carrier, adding that one of the three leased planes would arrive in the country for demonstration flights in a couple of weeks. According to him, the government is planning a dry lease of aircraft contrary to reports that the government is proposing a wet-lease arrangement.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/national-carrier-domestic-airlines-reject-nigeria-ethiopia-partnership/"},

The woes in the two sectors were responsible for the frightening rise in our inflation rate, he noted. On the recently presented 2023 budget, the LCCI said the N20.5tn ($47.3bn) proposed expenditure by the Federal Government to run the economy in 2023 reflected the vast needs in critical sectors of the economy.\n He said it was comforting that the 2023 budget was still at the proposal stage, adding that all well-meaning stakeholders needed to make constructive inputs to the presidency and the National Assembly.  He said, \u201cCan we consider more efficient alternatives to new borrowings? Can we issue equity to finance the deficit instead of using debt? Can we break the path in which the Federal Government only approaches the debt markets at home and abroad and never approaches the equity market at home or abroad? Investors invest in debt but they also invest in equity. \u201cOur approach should not be to continue issuing only debt, especially with the increasingly unbearable burden of interest payments that exposes our fiscal vulnerability.\u201d\n He added, \u201cWe can improve the performance of the 2023 budget by studying how the 2022 budget has performed.

The athletes carried placards conveying different messages, and called on Dare not to exclude them from the biennial festival. Following the protests, the Director, National Sports Festival and Para-sports at the Federal Ministry of Youth Development and Sports, Peter Nelson, explained that the festival was transitioning into two different Games, adding that the athletes were aware that they now have their own separate festival.\n \u201cThis protest is very unnecessary because the minister, Sunday Dare, has approved the Para-sports festival for special athletes and the second edition will be held next year,\u201d Nelson stated.\n Ajunwa noted that Para-athletes made a living from sports, adding that participating previously at the festival had given them a sense of belonging in the society. The police officer stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not right for the Para-athletes to be excluded from the National Sports Festival. The sports minister should have allowed them to enjoy what the able-body athletes are enjoying. I can\u2019t give a reason why the minister took that decision, if the international bodies deem it fit to allow Para-sports or Para-athletes at their events.\n \u201cImmediately the able-body athletes finish on stage, the special athletes take over.

I spent most of my days on the local primary school field and that\u2019s where the dream of wanting to play football began. I eventually started my career with Lucky Boys in Kaduna and then to Celtics Football Academy.\n Growing up wasn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m not from a wealthy family that could support my career, but thanks to my mum, she made a lot of sacrifices to help me fulfill my dream. She ensured I went to trainings and matches; she bought boots and jerseys, against the general belief in the community, where nobody believed in you and saw you as wayward when you chose to play football.\n \n I admire Nigerian clubs a lot. I remember the kind of feeling Enyimba gave me when they won the CAF Champions League in 2003. Plateau United came calling in 2013 and I didn\u2019t hesitate despite the fact that they were playing in the lower division, and ever since, my dreams have been coming true. I\u2019ve grown with Plateau United. The experience I\u2019ve had from the city of Jos to the club has been wonderful. The love the people of the state have for me has also been immense. I have won the league with Plateau United, I got a national team call up for the home-based Eagles and represented Nigeria at CHAN 2018 and I\u2019ve played in CAF competitions on three occasions now. It has been great because the love has been massive and every day on the pitch, I ensure that I give my best. Winning the league with Plateau United was special, because it was the first piece of achievement for me. I remember working so hard and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s something I can proudly put on my CV. \n I\u2019ve got offers from different Nigerian clubs, but I\u2019ve settled in very well in Jos and the management has treated me right from day one. They\u2019ve given me opportunities and whatever I ask for is usually given to me. So, I see no reason to jump from one club to the other. Also, the love I enjoy from the fans, the management makes me feel comfortable than I can be here for as long as I want.\n \n I believe my long throwing ability is an essential gift from God. I used it, my coaches saw it and developed it more. It\u2019s an ability that has kept me here and even make most teams want me.\n \n We could have done it again last season, but coming behind Rivers United was another kind of experience. We pushed hard but they were harder and the decider was the game we lost to them in Port Harcourt. Since then, we took our legs off the pedal and cemented our second place.\n The first leg in Abuja against Esperance was a big game for us, because Esperance are a big team and so many people in Nigerian did not even give us the chance at home. So, that thought alone, put in some level of fear. And yes, in the game, we respected Esperance a lot and that caused us to concede first. When they scored, as the captain of the team, the only thing I said to the boys was that we could do it, \u2018let us just pick up ourselves.\u2019 At that moment, I felt we blocked every opinion we heard before the game and that was the turning point for us. We scored two goals to win the match, and we could have even scored more.  \n For the second leg, we knew we were going for a difficult game against Esperance. Although we worked on every necessary area, taking into consideration the gimmicks and game plan, and we gave it our all on the pitch. But a single moment cut our dreams short. Nonetheless, I have to give my teammates, the coaches and other members of the backroom staff the credit for giving their best.\n \n After the penalty, we still had the strong feeling that we could do something, but at the same time, the referee awarding that kind of penalty with the time left on the clock limited the chances we could have explored.\n \n Assuming we played in Jos, there would have been a big difference, because we would be playing in front of our fans, and the crowd would have been massive. Playing against Esperance or any other team would have given us another edge. I feel we would have scored more and probably made a lot of difference in the return leg. \n With the spirit I\u2019ve seen in the team, from the players to the backroom staff, I know that we will make the group stage of the Confederation Cup, of course, with the support of everyone.\n \n \u00a0Everything that\u2019s been said is on point. But if you want a Nigerian club to perform on the continent, you have to give them all the support. And maybe our administrators can also position themselves strategically in CAF. Believe me, the North Africans know how to spend and get what they want on the continent. You know about the dominance of their teams in Africa and we will need a lot more in terms of support to do more than them.\n \n We don\u2019t know when the new NPFL season will start. We can only hope, because we know it is important to start early. This helps teams that will be playing on the continent to be ready as well in terms of match fitness. The previous season was challenging and that is one of the factors that helped those of us on the continent, so far. So, imagine that our calendar was perfect. Starting and ending the season with great spirits gave us some confidence on the continent, but it would have been better if our calendar was perfect.\n The Eagles coach was there with us in Tunisia, before the game, he talked to us and gave us every reason to believe in ourselves. He told us he believes in us and that\u2019s inspiring. The chances of NPFL players playing in the Super Eagles depends on the coach and the (NFF) board. We have great players in the NPFL who only desire a chance to prove themselves in the national team. If NPFL players can get the level of chances the players born abroad get, we will give everything. We are just hoping that after going round different venues in the NPFL and even following us to CAF inter-club games, the coach and his assistants will give NPFL players the chance to represent the Super Eagles again.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/late-esperance-penalty-hindered-plateaus-comeback-bid-itodo/"},

Asked at his pre-match press conference whether Ronaldo had refused to come on as a substitute against Spurs, Ten Hag said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n Ten Hag said, \u201cWhat (happened in) the talk is between Cristiano and me.

I am the manager. I am responsible for the top sport culture here and I have to set standards and values and I have to control them.\n \u201cWe are in a team, so we have standards, we have values and I have to control that. After Rayo Vallecano, I told (you) it was unacceptable but he wasn\u2019t the only one. That is for everyone.\n \u201cWhen it\u2019s the second time, that will have consequences. That is what we did. We miss him tomorrow. That is a miss for us. For the squad it\u2019s a miss.  \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important for the attitude and mentality from the group.

It never was. This is Manchester United, and united we must stand. Soon we\u2019ll be together again.\u201d\n The former Real Madrid and Juventus star scored 24 goals in all competitions in 2021/22 in his first season back at Old Trafford, where he made his name as a global star.\n But, disappointed by United\u2019s failure to qualify for the Champions League, he has tried and failed to engineer a move away from Old Trafford.\n Ronaldo, a five-time Champions League winner with Real and United, has started only two Premier League games this season and has just one goal to his name in the English top flight.\n The forward, who missed United\u2019s pre-season tour to Australia and Thailand for \u201cfamily reasons\u201d, also reacted badly when he was substituted by Ten Hag in last week\u2019s draw against Newcastle.\n AFP", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/there-will-be-consequences-for-ronaldos-behaviour-ten-hag/"},

Nigeria, who would be aiming to break their quarter-final jinx at this competition, are up against USA for the first time at this level, and this encounter is an opportunity for the West Africans to make history.\n Having failed to reach the semi-finals in six previous editions, the Nigerians set out to achieve the impossible, ending the country\u2019s 14-year wait for a last-four berth on their fourth quarter-final appearance.\n The Americans will hope to reach the semis for the first time since 2008, when they finished as runners-up at the inaugural edition in New Zealand. Meanwhile, ex-Super Falcons stars are optimistic the Flamingos can overcome the United States of America and reach the semi-finals of the U-17 Women\u2019s World Cup in India for the first time in the team\u2019s history.  Speaking ahead of the Flamingos\u2019 cracker against the Americans, Chioma Ajuwa, a former footballer, a member of the Falcons squad at the inaugural Women\u2019s World Cup in 1991, is optimistic about the Nigerians chances of reaching the last four.\n \u201cI will tell the girls to continue to remain calm and be focused, so that at the end of the day, they can come out in flying colours. They should go for the win, be very strong, put their heads up, be humble and pray for God\u2019s favour to excel against the US,\u201d Ajunwa stated.\n Former Super Falcons midfielder, Rita Nwadike, is also confident the Flamingos can cause an upset against their more illustrious foes.\n \u201cOur girls have done well, but the game against the US will be a tough one.

We have good players that can get the job done.\u201d\n She also rated Flamingos midfielder Opeyemi Ajakaye, who scooped back-to-back Player of The Match awards in their last two games, very high. \u201cAjakaye has been very impressive so far in this tournament, even though she\u2019s yet to score a goal. She is the one doing the major jobs on the field, and the US team will be scared of her.\u201d\n Another ex-Falcon, Stella Mbachu, added, \u201cNothing is impossible in football, it does not matter if they are playing against the best team in the world. The Flamingos will beat the USA, I\u2019m not doubting the capacity of our girls in this tournament, it\u2019s just for them to obey instructions, and they will come out with the win.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/flamingos-set-for-historic-clash-against-usa/"},

But to do so, they must first fly past the free-scoring Americans, who have been ruthless at the tournament, scoring 13 goals and conceding just one goal.\n PUNCH Sports Extra takes a look at the five things the Flamingos must do to stand a chance reaching the last four of the tournament in India.\n Though Nigeria are one of the countries who have conceded the least number of goals at the ongoing tournament, having let in just three goals, they will need to do more when they come up against the United States.\n After scoring 13 goals overall and only giving up one in the group round, the Americans are one of the tournament\u2019s free-scoring sides. They trounced hosts India 8-0 in their first game, drew 1-1 with Brazil and hammered Morocco 4-0 in their last Group A game.\n Olowookere must ensure his defence is watertight against the Americans, who have some of the best shooters of the ball at the tournament. Against Germany, the Flamingos conceded two goals that could have been avoided and were heavily punished as they were made to finish second behind the same opponents.\n To avoid a repeat of what happened against Germany, the Flamingos must be solid defensively, leaving little or no room for errors against the Americans.\n \n Another area the Flamingos will have to improve on is the opposition\u2019s end of the pitch. The young Nigerians have been wasteful in front of goal at the ongoing tournament and big evidence of that was against Chile, when they had 23 shots with just 11 on target and only two of those were able to beat the Red Ones goalkeeper.  Playing against opponents who are good at scoring goals, the Flamingos will need to ensure that they make good use of their chances if they want to stand a chance of making it through to the semi-final for the first time ever. \n The Flamingos must control the game, especially the midfield, if they hope to advance.\n After their defeat to Germany on match-day 1, where they lost possession to the Europeans, the Flamingos improved against New Zealand, winning possession of the game 56-44 to record a convincing 4-0 win.\n Against Chile, they had 57 per cent of the ball possession, while the North Americans had 43, but they will need to do better against the Americans today.\n \n The Nigerian team has an average age of 15.7, one of the youngest at the tournament, with midfielder Mary Aderemi the youngest (14). With the girls ages, the tendency to lose focus at any point during a match will be quite high.\n In their opening game, Olowookere\u2019s girls led the encounter for the most part but lost focus when it mattered most and they were punished for that by the Germans. In their last game, they held their ground against Chile, but as it was against the Germans, they took their feet off the pedal and allowed the South Americans to get back into the game to end the encounter on a nervous note. Today, they must ensure they stay focused for the entirety of the game because a minor slip could see them exit the tournament.\n \n The Flamingos always look more dangerous on the attack whenever the versatile Opeyemi Ajakaye is with the ball and this is something Olowookere and his technical crew must take advantage of.\n Ajakaye, who emerged as the top scorer in the qualifying stages in Africa, has been one of the best players so far at the tournament and has won the player of the match award twice.\n Against Chile, she rattled the crossbar with a thunderous strike, before providing the assist for Blessing Emmanuel\u2019s goal. Her passes and crosses are topnotch and the team will need to make good use of her qualities by getting her more involved in the game.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/five-things-flamingos-must-do-to-beat-us/"},

{"headline": "Nigeria\u2019s insurance industry needs govt support \u2013CEO, Krabond", "image_url": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/22210955/Kola-Ahmed.jpg", "author": "Nike Popoola", "posted_date": "23rd October 2022", "description": "It has been four decades of progressive growth and development for the insurance industry. The capacity of the industry has grown substantially and the knowledge base has also increased. The capital requirement has gone up from N200,000 to N5bn. The number of qualified professionals has increased but the same cannot be said of their professionalism. This is a big paradox. In the 80s and early 90s, there was specialisation both at corporate and individual levels. There used to be companies that were known for their specialisation in specific areas of insurance. Some companies were life specialists while some were known for their Engineering and Contractors\u2019 All Risks prowess. Others had their strength in accident (\u00a0 fire and burglary) and so on.\n At individual levels, some names were synonymous with certain class of business. The likes of Oviosu, Oladosu, Akinyemi and Shobowale were marine specialists. Wokocha, Oyetoyan and BS Oke all of Law Union & Rock were renown for Engineering and Contractors\u2019 All Risks. B.O. Banjo, Egwuonwu, Joda, Akamiokho, Alegiuno, Alhaji Mustapha, Mrs Rowaiye, Mrs Temowo, Ladipo Ajayi and Olatunji were accident specialists, while on the life side were people like Nsoma, Oyelami, Eleoramo, Shobanjo, among others. Back then, professionalism was the order of the day. Insurance companies acknowledged and respected individual companies\u2019 areas of strength. No company would quote on a slip for engineering where Law Union & Rock (Wokocha) had not put its signature. Also, once UNIC (Oviosu) had given a rate on marine, any company approached afterwards would readily follow the lead. Same goes for other classes where companies had comparative strengths.\n This mutual respect and understanding gave the industry sanity and professionalism as well as specialisation. The period could arguably be regarded as the golden age of insurance in Nigeria.\n As years went by, erosion of professionalism and specialisation started creeping in. Insurance companies started setting up marketing departments with little regard to the quality of business being procured. On the regulatory aspect, regulation was weak and almost non-existent. It was the industry that was self-regulating itself. Regulation and supervision have since improved over the years with the advent of the National Insurance Commission. There have been three cycles of recapitalisation with each heralding renewed vigour in the industry. Naturally, with each recapitalisation cycle, there were mergers and acquisitions with the industry becoming leaner, more sanitised and more manageable on the part of the regulator.\n \n Not really, but very interesting with high level of job satisfaction. When I joined the insurance industry in 1982 as a fresh graduate just coming into the industry that was not too receptive of university graduates, it was a bit of a challenge to find one\u2019s feet. The challenge one had then was that of acceptability and being given the opportunity to prove oneself. It was not too much of attractiveness but the challenge of fighting for the space to operate and to prove your mettle. Having studied Insurance in the university, one had no illusion of pursuing any other career other than insurance. One must give credit to our forebears, the pioneer set of Unilag insurance graduates (1978), who blazed the trail and set the stage for us. One cannot but pay tributes to them for their pioneering role. The likes of Eleoramo, Uzoma, Adepoyigi, Oyelotola, Ozioko, Oyelami and a host of others whose names I cannot recall. I assumed duty in Hogg Robinson Nigeria on Thursday, 19 October, 1982. As an \u2018established staff\u2019 as fresh graduates were referred to then, one had to learn the rope from well-trained and experienced but not too educated seniors. The training was rigorous but thorough. One had to trek, with your broking slip under your armpit, from Apongbon where AIICO was then situated and covering the whole stretch of Marina, visiting UNIC, Niger, SUN, NICON, Royal Exchange, and moving on to Ajele where Lion of Africa had its office and from there to LASACO at Catholic Mission Street, all in a bid to obtain rates for insurance proposals you would eventually place with them. It was a thorough but rewarding training and experience that would later shape one\u2019s career. The early years\u2019 experience as a broker trainee for 10 years with two brokers of diverse size sort of prepared and toughened one for the challenges ahead. Looking back today, one feels a sense of nostalgia for those years when professionalism, specialisation and market cohesiveness reigned supreme.\n \u00a0 \n The insurance sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP has consistently been below one per cent. This is very much at variance with the contribution of other sectors in the financial services industry. The major reason for this very poor performance is lack of government support. The government has not shown enough political will to enforce its own law on insurance, most especially the provisions on compulsory insurances. The government has failed to give the same level or proportional level of support to the insurance sector as is being given to the banking sector, both of which are operating in the financial services industry of the economy. This is largely due to lack of proper understanding and appreciation of the role of insurance in the economic development of any nation.\n \u00a0 \n \u00a0The insurance industry in Nigeria is evolving and the capacity is growing day by day in response to market demand and business complexities. Given the right atmosphere and enabling environment, I believe the insurance industry in Nigeria can rise up to the challenge and provide cover for any and various types of assets, property and liability no matter their size and complexity. The insurance industry is resilient, strong and capable of living up to the challenge of underwriting major risks using the local capacity. The initiative of the regulator in adopting Risk-Based Supervision is a step in the right direction as regards enhancing the industry capacity to take up large and major risks, as well as high-tech industries. \u00a0 \n The insurance industry\u2019s contribution to GDP over the years has been under one per cent. This is abysmally low considering our population and the size of our economy. However, the reason for this low growth and infinitesimal contribution to GDP is not far-fetched. If the insurance industry received as much as 50 per cent support government gives to the banking sector, the industry\u2019s contribution to the GDP will improve significantly. Therefore, the insurance industry needs the support of the government not only by legislation and law but by way of enforcement of existing laws. We have witnessed cases in the past where government came to the rescue of failing banks by giving them bailouts in billions of naira. No such thing has ever happened in insurance. The insurance industry could do with increased and sustained government support by ensuring and/or enforcing that all government property and assets are insured as provided for by the law. The premium for such insurance arranged to cover government assets \u2013 human and material \u2013 is paid fully and timely. The industry regulator, NAICOM, should also be empowered and strengthened to effectively carry out its supervisory, regulatory and market expansion roles.\n \u00a0 \n The insurance market is made up of majorly three trade bodies excluding the regulator and the training and examination body, the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria. The three trade bodies are the insurance companies, brokers and loss adjusters. The insurance companies, otherwise referred to as operators, are the risk- bearing arm of the industry. They are the ones that provide covers for the risks placed with them. They carry out survey, pre- or post-loss and they meet their obligations by payment of claims when the insured suffers a loss covered by the policy. The insurance companies in Nigeria trade under the umbrella of Nigerian Insurers Association.\n Insurance brokers, on the other hand, are the professional arm of the industry. They are professional intermediaries that bring the insured and insurance company together. Insurance brokers act as intermediaries between the buyers of insurance policy and insurance companies. Insurance brokers perform a myriad of functions on behalf of their clients, the buyers of insurance. An insurance broker possesses the professional skill and knowledge to assess risks and determine the likelihood of loss on an asset or investment and goes ahead to advise on the appropriate insurance cover to arrange for the protection of such asset or investment. Brokers engage in risk evaluation and assessment for their clients whereby they outline risk management strategies suitable for such clients. They advise their clients on the terms and conditions of the policy they have arranged, the rights and obligations of the clients under the policy and the procedure for reporting and documenting claims when losses occur. The insurance broker acts as consultants to their clients on all insurance matters affecting their business or operation.\n \u00a0 \n \u00a0Inflation affects all and sundry. But its effect on insurance is very profound. There is a popular saying that insurance is not bought but sold. Except for a few corporate companies and multinationals who buy insurance as a matter of policy and their overall business plan, the majority of business owners in this clime are only forced to take insurance by way of necessity to secure facility from financial institutions. For the individuals and small business owners, the insurance company occupies the lower rung in their spending priority, if not the lowest, which in fact the reverse should be the case. Therefore, in times of inflation, insurance becomes much more difficult to sell. This is because the disposable income of the populace is reduced and their purchasing power is curtailed. As such, they are forced to prioritise and reschedule their spending. In most cases, insurance is usually the first victim in the prioritisation scheme. On the other hand, for those companies that still have the financial muscle, it will be necessary for them to revalue their assets and shore up the sums insured on their policies. This will result in higher premium and increase production for the industry. \u00a0 \n \u00a0There are three critical indices that can have telling effect on any economy. Exchange rate is one of them. The other two are inflation and interest rates. With Nigeria being largely an import-dependent economy especially with our penchant for foreign goods and the inability of local industry to meet the large demand, it is inevitable that any change in the availability of foreign exchange will have a significant effect on all sectors of the economy, including insurance. Forex scarcity could have dual effect on insurance. In the first instance, the cost of insurable property, especially raw materials, plant and machinery will increase with the attendant rise in premium generated by the operators. On the flip side, the cost of reinsurance will go up as the operators will have to source for scarce forex to fund their reinsurance treaty premium.\n \u00a0 \n It will take the serious political will of the government at the centre in order for the law of compulsory insurance to be fully enforced. Also, the regulator (NAICOM) has to be effectively empowered and strengthened to be able to enforce compliance. Other measures that need to be taken to achieve full implementation of compulsory insurance include obtaining the buy-in of law enforcement agencies backed by proper training and encouragement by both the regulator and operators; domestication of law on compulsory insurance by state governments; massive, aggressive, sustained and widespread sensitisation and campaign by the market, regulator and operators.\n NAICOM is doing quite well in this regard by taking the campaign to various geographical zones of the country. Finally, the operators, especially the brokers who are the professional arm of the industry, have to step up their game by ensuring proper and adequate coverage of the market.\n \n Insurance plays a critical and pivotal role in the development of any economy. Any economy that downplays the role of insurance or that does not give insurance the deserved recognition will not achieve its full potential. As a risk transfer mechanism, insurance provides the critical security and support for trade, commerce and industry to venture without measure, such that they can go all out to pursue their goal of taking their businesses to an unprecedented height. Insurance provides the impetus to allow businesses and economy to grow, having taken off risks that could have hindered such progress. Insurance gives succour to businesses, especially the SMES in the event of unforeseen circumstances, thereby facilitating their early return to normalcy after an unfortunate incident. Therefore, any government or economy that embraces, encourages and supports insurance would have less to worry about\u00a0 in the event disasters such as the frequent market fire in Nigeria and would be able to channel the scarce resources to the provision of critical infrastructure\u00a0 and other economic benefits for its citizens.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/nigerias-insurance-industry-needs-govt-support-ceo-krabond/"},

The development came against the backdrop of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s recent discount window tightening.\n The CBN recently insisted that certain categories of its authorised dealers are not allowed to access the discount window on specified transactions.\n The central bank stated this in a circular to all dealers on the access to the discount window, which was dated October 7, 2022, and signed by the apex bank\u2019s Director, Financial Markets Department, Dr Angela sere-Ejembi. It specifically reminded participants with successful bids at the Open Market Operations auctions to refrain from accessing the discount window on the auction date.\n The apex bank warned that henceforth, failure for non-compliance to the directive shall result in the reversal of the allotment.\n Similarly, the bank emphasised that successful bids at the government securities auctions, including the Nigerian Treasury Bills, FGN Bonds, and Sukuk, are not permitted to access the CBN discounted window on the settlement date.  The CBN explained that the move was necessitated by the non-adherence to the provisions guiding access to the discount window despite two previous circulars on the subject in 2012 and 2016.\n It appears that the recent discount window tightening has impacted the FGN Bonds at the primary market auction, forcing local banks to play safe as a possible breach of CBN discount window rules attracts severe financial penalties.\n Reacting, an investment research analyst at Meristem Securities Limited, Mr Damilare Ojo, said that there were a number of reasons for the low bond subscription, including the CBN tightening policy.\n He said, \u201cIt is very low, unlike what we have been seeing in terms of subscription. One reason is the CBN tightening policy, which has reduced liquidity from participating institutions, particularly banks. \u201cAlso, when looking at the system generally, liquidity is very low. The market seems to be saying that for the government to get funds for its budget, it needs to up its game.\n \u201cFurthermore, in recent times, there have been speculations that the DMO wants to securitise the ways and means, which is over N20tn, competing with the 2023 budget, which is a huge amount. So, it seems people are holding back from that bond auction to see whether they will be better opportunities.\u201d\n Also, reacting to this, a research analyst at Atlas Portfolios Limited, Mr Olaide Baanu, said that the low subscription could be a result of higher rates in secondary markets.\n He said, \u201cSince the CBN began the rate hikes to curb inflation, rates in the fixed income secondary market began to trend upward and this poses reasonable returns for investors.\n \u201cHowever, the recent under-subscription of DMO N225bn offer could be attributed to higher rates in the secondary market compared to the rates presented by the DMO.\u00a0 Also, many investors are taking advantage of the exchange rate to invest in dollar-denominated funds.\u201d\n He also noted that this shortfall might not affect the Federal Government\u2019s ability to finance its budget deficit as the government can source money elsewhere, like through borrowing from the CBN.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/dmo-fails-to-raise-n117bn-cbn-tightens-policy/"},

This will be awarded to winning Bidders in 100 MHz Lot.\u201d According to the NCC, five licences will eventually be awarded for the deployment of 5G in the nation. With its new move, one more 5G licence will still be auctioned.\n At the \u2018Stakeholders Consultative Forum on the Draft Information Memorandum for the 3.5GHz Spectrum Auction\u2019 in 2021, the commission said, \u201cFive lots of 100 MHz each TDD are to be cleared at different periods depending on the level of encumbrances on the slots.\u201d\n It stated that all its spectrum would be auctioned by 2023. Remember that in 2021, the commission sold two slots of 3.5 GHz spectrum to MTN Communications Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited for $273.6m each. By setting the price of two more licences at $273.6m, the Federal Government will make at least $1.09bn from total spectrum sales. The final cost of the available spectrum is expected to rise during the actual auction. The NCC set the reserve price for the 5G licenses that MTN and Mafab won at $197.4m, but they eventually paid $273.60m each for their licences.\n During the process that led to the launching of 5G in the nation, operators in the telecommunication had space raised eyebrows about the high cost of 5G spectrum.\n At the time, MTN and Airtel had said the reserve price of $197.4m was too high and above what was obtained in other climes of the world.\n While both telcos were a part of the auction process, Airtel pulled out because of the high cost of the final bid. According to the Group Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Africa, Segun Ogunsanya, the firm pulled out after submitting a final bid of $270m.\n He said, \u201cThe business case for 5G across all sub-Saharan markets is evolving, and we remain committed to driving broadband capacity in our various markets. We will continue to closely track the 5G ecosystem over the next several years, in particular the availability of affordable 5G devices and relevant use cases.\u201d  MTN has since rolled out 5G services in select locations across the nation with Mafab getting regulatory approval to delay its launch until December.\n While speaking on the cost of spectrums, the Chairman, Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria, Gbenga Adebayo, said, \u201cFor us in the sector, we are most concerned about the cost of 5G. This new direction will require a lot more investment, and the current infrastructure might not be sufficient and efficient for it. \u201cSo, we need to address the issue of cost. In order not to have 5G that is only glamorously deployed and not efficient, we need to address the issue of cost.\u201d\n According to GSMA, the global body for operators in the sector, high spectrum prices might affect the plan to achieve affordable Internet access for a large portion of the populace.\n The Chief Operating Officer, Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria, Ajibola Olude, said, \u201cThe reserve price is the same price at which the first one was sold.\n \u201cYes, there were complaints about the price of the spectrum, but as a result of bidding, it eventually went higher than the estimated cost. I think Airtel will want to get it because they need 5G to remain competitive in the market.\n \u201cHigh spectrum prices will increase the cost of rollout. Although the telecoms industry is market driven and responds to demand and supply.\u201d\n Initially, the spectrum price was low but as a result of competition in the industry, they were able to get a higher value for it. I don\u2019t support high spectrum prices but since the market is driven by market forces there is nothing, we can do about it.\u201d\n He added, \u201c5G will drive a lot of innovation, and a Mobile Network Operator that does not offer 5G as a service may be forced out of the market. They need it to remain competitive so from the look of things, Airtel will want to get one of the slots because the future of telecoms rests on 5G.\u201d Recently, the NCC told the government that it was set to generate over N500bn in 2023 through the 5G spectrum sales.\n The Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Prof.Umar Danbatta, disclosed this during an interactive meeting on 2023-2025 MTEF-FSP, organised by the Senate Committee on Finance.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/fgs-earnings-from-spectrum-sales-rise-to-1-09bn/"},

The committee members were drawn from private and public sectors with specific issues relating to the trusteeship of funds for off-plan development, sustainable governance structure, insurance guidelines and rules, strata law and devolution of ownership and residents association law, with the State mortgage law under view at the Lagos State House of Assembly. \u201cLASRERA\u2019s registration portal has over 200 (Two hundred) registered Real Estate individual/ organization despite the fact that over 2000 compliance letters were delivered to those operating in Real Estate business transactions in the State.\n \u201cThis number does not represent the number of operators in the State; however, it is worthy of note that more practitioners are still approaching the Agency to formalize their operations and register with LASRERA.\u201d\n According to the keynote speaker, with the establishment of the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority, investors could be assured that every viable investment put in the Lagos State real estate sector would be guaranteed a return on investment. Benson-Awoyinka noted that the good reputation of the real estate industry must be sustained despite the incidences of building collapse, fraudulent and unprofessional practices in the industry.  She said \u201cAs a government, our ultimate goal is to create conducive environment through a reliable and effective regulatory system that ensures all players in the Built Sector conform to establish standards and code of conduct at both State and Local Government levels.\n \u201cI must acknowledge and make reference to several reported cases of building collapse in different parts of the State and series of fraudulent cases of property developers/agents defrauding prospective tenants, these trends are unprofessional in the Real Estate Industry and we are determined to uncover the roots of these happenings and bring the culprits to book.\n \u201cTo eradicate these malpractices in Lagos Real Estate Sector all hands must be on deck. However, the sensitization and implementation of the State Government\u2019s regulatory framework must commence with the registered members of the Built sector.\u201d\n Benson-Awoyinka urged members of the association to comply with the state government regulations in business transactions and building structures in the state.\n Earlier, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works & Infrastructure, Bayo Odusanya, noted that the builders\u2019 forum was positioned as a platform for professionals in the built industry to brainstorm on issues that could improve delivery of affordable mass housing, professionalism, welfare and wealth of the nation.\n He said, \u201cAs a Government or as Private Investors, we are desirous of providing of Mass Housing, we are limited by challenges such as affordability in terms of pricing of the homes and that of purchasing the property by the citizens as well as the sustenance/maintenance of the provided Housing Units or sometimes the cost and difficulty in the Process of Title Documentation are issues I think this conference can begin to address. \u201cAlso issues including High Cost of Construction and High Cost of Land which ultimately increases the Cost of Project and which in turn is reflected in the Sale Price should be addressed. More so, when the Cost of Infrastructure is considered as a major component in the overall Project Cost, then we need to find a way to ensure that mass Housing becomes affordable.\n \u201cAs professionals, we all know that the type of technology adopted for Construction significantly impacts on the Project Cost just as statutory Fees and Charges in the area of Stamp Duty, Registration of Title, Physical Planning Fees, Tax and other Statutory Fees also aggregate into increased Cost of Purchase.

Speaking to the issue, Olajire, who is a professor of geography at the Niger Delta University, Yenagoa, said in a telephone interview with our correspondent that the whole world was experiencing climate change, and that one of the effects was extreme weather events, manifesting in the form of excessive precipitation and high temperatures. He noted that human beings had also worsened the situation.\n He stated, \u201cThere is the element of nature and then human factors cresting our present scenario. One of the solutions is to create detention dams to contain the excess water, enabling the control of water into the farmlands, like in the case of Kogi State.\n \u201cAlso, we have to dredge our major rivers, widen them and make the valley deeper, so that they can contain more water. This was done in the Ogunpa Valley in Ibadan, Oyo State. We also have to keep people out of the flood plain, because they are disturbing the ecosystem with urban developments within the floodplain. \u201cWe have to encourage forestation, which is very commendable because, with it, the surface of the land would be covered, and the rainwater would infiltrate the soil rather than flow into the river. So, it would prevent a situation where filth would be carried into the river valley, making the valley shallow.\u201d\n Also, Wusu, speaking in Lagos at the 31st Lagos builders\u2019 conference and annual general meeting on Friday, said the government must discourage deforestation and encourage forestation and modern waste management. The event had the theme, \u2018The Shifting Landscape \u2013 Redefining the Real Estate Industry.\u2019\n He added, \u201cWhen the ground is void and erosion comes, everything would be carried away. It is hard for you to see a forest where erosion happens because there are vegetations there which hold together the soil.\n \u201cClearing lands and vegetation without paying cognisance to flooding and wind is not advisable. Obviating deforestation and recycling of wastes for re-usage are still the most probable solution to flooding in Nigeria.\u201d\n He said in accordance with global standards, some places were meant to be reserved to receive the flood water because rivers tend to overflow their banks during the rainy season.\n  had reported the Chairperson, National Executive Council of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, Chief Ede Dafinone, as saying during a panel discussion at the 20th Chief S.L Edu Memorial Lecture that rising sea levels and other climate change impacts might get worse if not averted, noting that the world was experiencing the consequences of the disregard for earlier warnings.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/afforestation-crucial-to-averting-future-flooding-experts/"},

The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority is there to oversee the industry. The ministry\u2019s responsibility is to draw out policy guidelines for the civil aviation authority to provide regulations. That is the way the job is separated. Unfortunately, what we have seen in the last seven to eight years now is that the same ministry drawing out policies is the same body operating the policies. It is never done, and that is why we are where we are. The NCAA is practically doing nothing. The operators are also taking directives from the ministry. Every operator has its Act, and there is an Act for FAAN, NAMA, AIB, and others. And the Act is drawn with a policy from the ministry. So, the problem we are having now is we do not know who is regulating. For example, all the money in the industry is not recoverable. We have the intervention of 2007. How much of the intervention funds have been used or recovered between 2007 and 2022?\n Apart from the revenue the industry earns, how much have they remitted? Just last year or two years ago, they were asked to remit 25 per cent of their earnings and they told the government it was not possible. And what has the government done about it? We are taking money from other social services like roads and ASUU and putting it into the aviation industry. How many people benefit from these intervention funds? How much have we invested in road transport in the last 10 years? We have been building Lagos-Badagry road since the time of Obasanjo. It shows we are not serious. That is why I am in support of the concession of the airport, but there are many clauses around that. If we are going to concession airports, how much money is expected to be generated from it? What is the baseline of income? Have we been able to work it out? No, because, as of today, they do not know how much they generate from each airport.\n \n I do not think so. Most of them talk because they are coming into the industry to make money and go away. How can you come into an industry and pay for the services? The problem is that they do not have robust business plans before coming into the industry. Unfortunately, the regulatory agency that is supposed to check their business plans didn\u2019t do a thorough job before allowing them to run. When are you coming into the industry? Which aircraft or equipment do you want to use to come into the industry? Where do you want to go within the industry? How many passengers are you expecting within that area? Those are the things to draw out, and people in NCAA should be able to look into these things. Many of them are recycling the business plans of airlines that have collapsed. In the days of Nigerian Airways, the airline will not run 737 to Kano four or five times a day. The maximum was going to be twice. It will be the 737 first in the morning, and subsequent trips to Kano are F28. Secondly, the attempt to maintain air charges from the last 10 years does not make economic sense, especially as we are not manufacturing fuel here. When we were manufacturing the fuel here, tickets were sold for $100. The dollar has stayed the same since 1990. Rather, the dollar has been increasing against naira.\n So, how can you be carrying passengers for N25,000 when the dollar was N500? I told them then that you can only carry passengers for N50, 000. When we were flying at $100, the country was producing Jet A1. Today, you are importing fuel, and the dollar has increased considerably against naira, yet you still want to sell for the same price.\n Third, they are complaining about NAMA charges. How much are they charging? How many of them are paying for landing and parking?\u00a0 I told them if you are paying anything less than $500 for landing and parking, then you are not being serious. Even those who are collecting less than that from you, if they concession that airport today and give it to people who know the value of services to provide, most of these airlines will close shop.\n I worry that we are not doing the business the way we should. The operational cost of some airlines today per hour is not less than $1000. Most airlines that fly into the country are about $3000 per hour. So, when you fly six hours, do the maths. That tells you all these big airlines across do $4000 per hour.\n \n They have to understand what is called the Bilateral Air Service Agreement. In the BASA, it is stated there that the \u201cnational carrier\u201d question we should ask is, do we have a national carrier? If we do not, we can find a way to designate flag carriers. Arik and\u00a0 Aero in those days went round the countries on their own to go and negotiate with the countries. Like Airpeace has done with Emirates, South Africa.\n It is not something that officials of the ministry will need to follow them around to negotiate, no. Do not compare yourself with American airlines. They are all flag carriers with support from their governments. Any American airline is a flag carrier unless we designate our private airlines as flag carriers and give them room to be in the BASA. It is not that they will go to all of them. They did this for ADC, Aero, and Afri Jet in the 90s. After some time, when it did not work, ADC went to Liberia and Sierra\u2013Leone, flying as national carriers for them. If you cannot get a national carrier, put two airlines together, go for their assets and debts and find investors to buy into it. There is nothing that AMCON can do. AMCON is just messing up everywhere. Find the assets of two airlines, find their debts, separate the debts and find the balance. Then, look for people to buy into them.  If you cannot combine the two airlines, then separate them, and see which one will go out quickly. This is for intercontinental flight carriers.\n This is what should be done. They said Arik owed over N300bn within four or five years after coming into operation. And I said, if Arik is making N10bn profit every year without making the dollar, it will take a minimum of 10 years for Arik to clear the debt under the condition with AMCON. It will even take a minimum of 30 years, but now they are talking of a national carrier. To make it worse, we are going to join Ethiopian Airlines.\n I have warned, do not to go into any partnership with your competitors in BASA. Look for people that are not your competitors in BASA from outside Europe and US first.\u00a0 That is the only way we can move forward. We have done this thing before with South African Airlines, but it did not work. It seems we have not learned from past experiences and that is why I have no confidence in any move being made now.\n Except we decide to concession the airport, but don\u2019t concession the aeronautical services.\n \n Foreign airlines contribute a minimum of 80 per cent of our commercial aviation in the country. Our local airlines are not paying for landing and parking. How much are they paying? Each of the airlines that come into this country pays nothing less than $2000. So, compare $2000 to someone paying $100. If there is anything that happens and they pull out the way they are doing now, obviously, we will lose. \n What I am saying is, what do we aim to achieve with TRACON? Of course, it needs upgrading, but it was supposed to be done almost every year. The programme for upgrading was given to NAMA. There are so many things wrong with TRACON. One, the contract for TRACON was signed by a managing director. Three months after it was signed, they removed the primary reader from it \u2013 by the same person who signed it. Later on, another MD removed training from the cost. Another person removed the Very Small Appetite Terminal. It was in this process that we had issues. In fact, it got to the stage that one of the new MDs was going to cancel the whole programme but they had paid almost N30bn. TRACON was supposed to cost about $56m. What I am saying is after 10 years of commissioning, let us find out how much the maintenance cost is again. What I don\u2019t know is if the money budgeted has plans for controller training.\n In 2007, NAMA had a shortage of 300 controllers and there was a plan to train them. Between 2007 and now, how many airports have we opened, especially for states still managed by NAMA? So, how many have they trained so far?\n \n The question is, do they have sufficient air controllers to man all the airports they are managing? Have they filled all the gaps they have before, including the new airports being opened? Are they thinking of those retiring in the next six years? If they are looking at 100 in the next six years, that is 16 controllers for every year.\n \n We have been in category two for a long time. What is wrong with us getting to category one? We have been in category two since the ICAO audit of 2009. The regulatory agency should be up and doing on its audit of the airport. Let us find a way to differentiate between the perimeter fence and security firms. \n There is nothing we can do unless we have an autonomous agency without interference from political officeholders who have interests in the operators. I thought that we would experience a drastic change in the aviation sector.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/most-airlines-lack-robust-business-plans-aviation-consultant/"},

I am not the most intelligent, smartest, or brightest scholar out there, I am just a passionate, committed, persistent, and determined person who hardly takes no for an answer. So, to answer this question, I had to start with my survival strategy. Of course, any academic journey comes with a lot of hardship \u2013 there were times I asked myself if I was ready for what I had got myself into. There were times I double checked on my sanity. You have to be adept at independent research; you have to be attuned to rejection. My journey in the academic field has been fraught with all of that and more. But, while some may call it providence or luck or the alignment of the stars, I would say I just approach any daunting task with a winning mindset.\n There are different sides to the comedy industry. For example, there is stand-up comedy, sitcoms, and the now popular type of comedy in the form of skits. While there are some challenges common to all of these types and mediums of comedy, each is also bedeviled by its own unique challenges. The world has evolved a lot in recent times, sometime ago, you were not considered as having had a real cinematic experience without having visited a cinema to watch actors performing live on a stage, then came the big screen and home entertainment where you either watch studio-produced movies either in a cinema or on your home entertainment system via movie streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video and so on. If you were used to going to the cinemas in those days, you would conclude that the new culture of watching predominantly studio-produced movies is killing the skills you acquire from stage performances. With studio productions, all your flaws are edited and covered up. You have a tendency to be somewhat lazy in memorizing and delivering your lines. When you apply this to comedy, you will realize that the culture of standup comedy is dying.\n \n Nowadays, people rely more on filters and editing measures to create content. While there are advantages to those stunts and effects, the effect is that the content makers don\u2019t master the craft of stage performances. It is a different ball game entirely. With this might come a risk of comedy fans losing interest in and developing lethargy for standup comedy. The thrill of purchasing tickets and driving all the way to a standup comedy event might be lost. Why would anyone want to lose sleep over a standup comedy show when he or she could just watch it in the comfort of his or her home on a mammoth sized curved TV with surround stereo speakers? \n Yes and no. Yes, because as earlier mentioned, if the fans get to a level where they get their thrills more from the filters and effects, they might as well just be entertained and amused by these skits from the comfort of their homes. However, the answer is also no because some folks are core fans of standup comedy. Skit-makers and standup comics have different skill sets and are excelling differently in their respective fields. It takes years of practice and honing of your skills to stand in front of a crowd and perform. It takes a skit-maker an idea and some attention to detail to shoot a skit and promote it online. With all sense of modesty, I daresay that a standup comic may be able to excel in the field of skit-making armed with a good idea and the right team. But it would take years of practice for a skit-maker to jump on the stage and move a crowd.\n \n My move to the US was divinely orchestrated. This is because I was recommended as being eligible for a category of professionals with special abilities in a chosen field. I also had ideas about replicating my work with an academy I established in Nigeria for young and aspiring entertainers. I have a dream to tell the story of Africans and African Americans through the lens. I want to take our form of entertainment, particularly black-oriented entertainment, to the ends of the world. And yes, I am keeping my comedy alive. I have been performing in some concerts and comedy shows in some parts of the US. And when I am opportune, I still anchor shows and perform at events in Nigeria. I\u2019m still connected to my roots.\n \n Like I said earlier, I remain connected to my roots. I am still contributing and will continue to contribute to the development of Nigeria, being the place where I broke out as an entertainer. Whether I intend to return is not a subject I have not considered. I am at home in the US also. I will continue to contribute to the growth and development of any home that God has provided to me.

Most of these projects are being developed in conjunction with private developers and we will continue to explore the public-private partnership model in order to continue to enjoy the robust benefit it offers to the sector and its effectiveness in delivering more housing units to meet the demand of an increasing population. Our ongoing land reform is our firm commitment to addressing the challenge of housing deficits in Lagos state.\n \u201cWe have strengthened our policy of delivering homes to Lagosians through a convenient mortgage system tagged Rent-To-Own. Also, the monthly rent payment policy to ease the hardship usually experienced by the people, especially low income earners, is expected to be a win-win situation for both the tenants and landlords as it would create a steady stream of income for property owners. I wish to use this opportunity to solicit the support of property owners and stakeholders to embrace the policy and ensure that it succeeds.\u201d  According to the governor, to manage the activities of stakeholders in the real estate sector, the law that established the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority was activated, and the agency was saddled with investigating complaints and petitions against licensed and unlicensed real estate practitioners and property developers, and imposed sanctions in accordance with the law. Sanwo-olu urged serious-minded investors to join hands with the state for a speedy resolution of the housing deficit challenge, reiterating that the investment opportunities in the sector were huge and rewarding.\n The Chairman of REDAN Lagos, Bamidele Onalaja, noted that real estate investment in Nigeria had become one of the major investments attracting both local and foreign investors.\n He said, \u201cFrom the commercial city of Lagos to every nook and cranny of the nation, several individuals and companies now engage in real estate investment.\n However, the industry is faced with unprecedented challenges, such as inflation which has led to a spike in the cost of building materials and the adverse effect of global warming, which has seen a reduction of available land especially in Lagos state due to flooding and erosion.\n \u201cFor this reason and more, there is every need to secure the future of the real estate industry. It\u2019s a given that real estate is the only secured investment for an assured future. However, with the challenges facing the industry globally, there is a need for us to think outside the box on ways to tackle these crises.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/land-reform-to-address-lagos-housing-deficit-sanwo-olu/"},

Within two months after the contract was awarded, Ekpemupolo announced the discovery of at least 58 illegal points in Delta and Bayelsa states where crude oil was being stolen.\n The former leader of the militant group, Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta, told journalists recently in Delta State that a 4km illegal oil pipeline was discovered in the Forcados area of the state.\n \u201cI think we have found over 58 points that have been tapped in both Delta and Bayelsa states. We are doing this work together with the security agencies. We are only providing intelligence for the security people to assist to do the work,\u201d he reportedly stated. When told about the discoveries by Tompolo and asked if the Federal Government would probe the theft and punish those responsible, the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC Limited, Garba-Deen Muhammad, said culprits would be prosecuted.\n \u201cSince it is a breach against the law, whether on pipelines or not, the law will certainly take its course. But it is not NNPC that will handle that aspect,\u201d he stated.\n Muhammad added, \u201cIt is the law itself, the GCEO (Group Chief Executive Officer) said it on site when he visited the areas. He said when these people are found the law will take its course.\u201d\n On whether the oil firm had instituted a probe into the menace, the GGM replied, \u201cSince the GCEO has spoken about it, you don\u2019t need anybody to say anything else about it. You can use that as the final statement from the NNPC.\u201d\n Muhammed was referring to the statement of the NNPC GCEO, Mele Kyari, at a recent meeting in Abuja, where he (Kyari) said the oil firm had embarked on a series of interventions to tackle the crime.  Kyari had said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to say that the interventions that we have seen in terms of the security measures we have taken, in collaboration with the government security agencies, with the private surveillance and security contractors, and the investments that we have done, we believe that in the next couple of days we will be able to bring back the Trans Niger Pipeline.\u201d\n The TNP has been shut down for several months due to crude oil theft on the line. Kyari added, \u201cAnd we will also restore production into the Forcados Terminal. That way we are sure that we can see at least 400,000 barrels coming into space. And as we continue to progress with security intervention, we will be able to bring back the other production facilities.\n \u201cThere are a number of things we are doing, including alternative evacuation processes. Until we are able to secure the lines and restore their integrity, there are certain lines that we will not bring back into production.\n \u201cSo ultimately, our aim is to get back the production and it is not out of control. We are getting back and you will see what will happen. Our security agencies are doing a great job on it.\u201d\n Kyari, while explaining why the surveillance contract was awarded to the ex-militant leader, had argued that it was not the first time such a contract was awarded to individuals in the region.\n However, experts gave diverse views with respect to the contract. Some kicked against it, while others described it as a good development.\n Prof. Wumi Iledare, an Associate Editor of SPE Journal of Economics and Management, while commenting on it, wondered if the move would not promote criminality in the region.\n \u201cThat you have an individual having the know-how to stop the theft of a commodity that a whole navy could not stop leaves much to be desired. We only hope this will not further promote criminality in the Niger Delta,\u201d he stated. But on his part, the former President, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr. Sam Nzekwe, said the pipeline contract would help curb oil theft and was in order.\n He said, \u201cIt is not that our security agencies are not working, but the fact is that this man (Tompolo) is from the grassroots and understands the area more than the security officers. That is he has been able to see where these activities happen.\n \u201cHe has more intelligence and that is why he\u2019s making progress this fast. He knows the terrain better than those who were securing it in the past. So I think it is a good development because our desire is to stop oil theft.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/fg-steps-up-oil-theft-probe-begins-prosecution/"},

On the other hand, the lowest price was recorded in Rivers with N686, followed by Bayelsa with N715 and Nasarawa with N735.\n In addition, analysis by zone showed that the South-East recorded the highest average retail price per litre of the product with N1,128, followed by the South-West with N1,068, while the North-West recorded the lowest with N869.\n The average retail price per gallon of the products paid by consumers in September 2022 was N3,236, showing an increase of 10 per cent from N2,948 in August 2022.

In July, one gallon of cooking kerosene was sold for N790, an increase of 3.68 per cent compared to N761.69 recorded in June.\n State oil company, the Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited had recently halted importation of the product, leading to continuous hike in prices by independent marketers.\n The Group Chief Executive Officer, NNPC Ltd, Mele Kyari, said more than 70 per cent of the over 200 million Nigerian population lack access to clean cooking fuels. The price of cooking gas has also skyrocketed.\n The National President of the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Oladapo Olatunbosun, while responding to an exclusive report by The PUNCH revealed that gas consumption had dropped drastically to 800,000 metric tonnes per annum from 1, 250 million MT per annum recorded about four months ago. According to him, given Nigeria\u2019s huge population, the country should consume at least six million MT per annum.\n \u201c800, 000MT per annum is the current consumption rate in Nigeria. A few months ago we were doing 1,250 million MT per annum.\n \u201cOrdinarily, given our population in this country, we should consume about six million MT per annum just like other African countries like\u00a0 Morocco , Egypt, Algeria, Kenya , South Africa and other countries. But these countries currently consume more LPG than Nigeria despite our huge population,\u201d, he told The PUNCH in a telephone chat.\n Meanwhile, financial and economic experts have advised the government to intervene in the situation to ameliorate the challenges facing Nigerians.\n \u00a0A former Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, said the government\u2019s intervention is quickly needed to bring down the costs of the product for the sake of the poor masses.\n He said, \u201cThe astronomical increase in the price of cooking kerosene will further aggravate the poverty situation in the country. Household kerosene is not a luxury, it is a necessity. It is bad enough that we are grappling with high food inflation, and now there is an additional burden of an escalating cost of means of cooking the food. So for the average Nigerian and the poor, this is an added burden, and obviously, the impact on poverty will be very profound.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "business", "url": "https://punchng.com/kerosene-price-soars-by-118-fuels-anxiety/"},

However, because he had already served six years and eight months in detention, the judge ordered his release.\n The 45-year-old controversial figure in the Yoruba movie industry, was arraigned by the police for alleged fraud involving N39m; $90,000 and \u00a312,550, N39,098,100, respectively.\n Egbegbe, who once managed Fuji artistes, Wale Ayinde, aka Tekoma and Wasiu Alabi, aka Pasuma, was accused of defrauding the BDC operators.

When one unconsciously has a gift with supportive parents, that helps to harness one\u2019s gift. Basically, my parents were a major influence in my decision to be an actor. They never discouraged me and they saw the need for me to pursue that gift. At age seven, my dad introduced me to my first role in \u2018Silence\u2019, which was produced and directed by Tunji Bamishigbin in 1997/1998. From that point, I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n The challenges are many. After my first acting role, I didn\u2019t get any job till I was 13 years old. Then, I starred in a popular television series, \u2018Kamson and Neighbours\u2019. A lot of people both in Nigeria and outside the country loved the series then. I was enjoying fame at a very young age but it was short-lived. After a couple of years of that series running, I went to square one. In my head, I thought that after that role, I had proved myself that I am a good actor and producers would naturally use me for jobs, and I didn\u2019t have to go for auditions. However, the reverse was the case.\n After that series ended, I had to go back for auditions. I was now wondering if I didn\u2019t know how to act or if these people didn\u2019t watch \u2018Kamson and Neighbours\u2019 (smiles). That was the point that I knew that the acting industry is not a child\u2019s joke. I had to fight, cross all the hurdles and rise through the ranks.\n While studying Theatre Arts at the University of Lagos, I still went for auditions. However, I was turned down many times. I skipped classes at times and I would probably get one or two scenes, a non-speaking role or a \u2018waka pass\u2019. This made me doubt myself, but I had to put that aside. I had to face the struggle. Hearing the stories of other pioneers in the industry made me strive. If I had not faced those challenges, I would not be where I am today. \n \u00a0My notable achievements will include my role in \u2018Kamson and Neighbours\u2019. Some people still remember my role as Nathaniel even though I was a young nerdy boy with glasses then. After that, I will say \u2018Jenifa\u2019s Diary\u2019 is another notable achievement. It is not like I did not do other stuff in-between. When people see me and they are struggling to say my name, I help them say, \u2018Are you trying to call me Nathaniel of Kamson and Neighbours, Timini of Jenifa\u2019s Diary, or Samson of My Siblings and I?\u2019 I also played a role in \u2018Omo Ghetto the Saga\u2019. These are my notable achievements and there are still more to come.\n \n \u2018Jenifa\u2019s Diary\u2019 was a blessing to my life. I have been looking for the opportunity for a long time. Before I got the role, I almost quit acting because I wasn\u2019t getting roles. I felt that since I studied Theatre Arts, I would be a coach for actors and a professor in the course. This propelled me to do my Master\u2019s at UNILAG in 2015/2016. During my Master\u2019s, an audition notice came from Scene One Production for a new project they were about to do titled, \u2018Industreet\u2019. Sincerely, I did not want to go because I had gone for several auditions where I was not later selected, and I knew how the crowd would be. However, one of my friends encouraged me to go. I got the role on \u2018Industreet\u2019 after so many hurdles.\n After that, Funke Akindele (Scene One Production boss) asked me what I do asides acting. I told her I didn\u2019t have a job because I was doing my Master\u2019s at that time. That was it! I just became a production manager overnight with her company. Akindele is someone who believes one can always do something and learn if one is willing. I was initially a crew member of \u2018Jenifa\u2019s Diary\u2019 before an opening for Timini\u2019s role came up. She told me that I am a very good actor and that she had penned a role for me to become Jenifa\u2019s personal assistant (Timini). That was how that character came to life. That became my turning point. There is nowhere I go that people don\u2019t refer to me as Timini or Nathaniel. However, Nathaniel\u2019s character was a long time ago and some people don\u2019t remember the character anymore, but Timini\u2019s character is still fresh.\n After featuring in the series, I have got more fans from England, Namibia, The Gambia and France. I am wowed that I am known in these countries. The reach has been crazy and I can\u2019t explain it. This project has been very impactful on my career and it re-announced me to my world. I have gone from being an actor to a director in the series. I am very grateful to Akindele for the platform.\n Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Akindele is the easiest person to work with. She has run Scene One Production for about 14 years now, while she has been acting for over two decades. This is because she is strong and faces her job, especially knowing that the industry is male dominated. She has to be dogged and strict to excel. That is what has kept her business moving. All the content she has done has been successful so far.\n \n It goes beyond work. She is like a mother to me because the training she gave me is what I am supposed to pay to learn in a film school. However, she gave it to me on a platter. It is by resilience and not by sleeping or chilling. She is God-sent to me and other people. She is an amazing person.\n \n Yes, it did in many ways. The first thing Theatre Arts gave me is discipline. It is the reason I could cope and align with Akindele\u2019s vision when I joined \u2018Jenifa\u2019s Diary\u2019. In terms of acting, it was a different ball game entirely when I gained admission to study the course and I started doing stage plays. I was used to screen acting. Screen acting is a soft life (laughs). One can forget a line and it will be re-taken unlike on-stage acting.\n \n I am someone that is not affected by peer pressure. That is supposed to be a gift and I am thankful for it. The training from my parents moulded me that way. I am not the regular kind of actor who does things to blend with the crowd. \n One of them is the decision to be patient. I feel that it is one great virtue that many people don\u2019t possess and I am thankful that I have it. If I wasn\u2019t patient till when I went to the audition to act with Akindele, I may still do well but I may not be doing what I love. I also thank God for the decision to study Theatre Arts because I knew I needed grooming.\n \n It is the love for what I do because sometimes acting can be hard and inconvenient.\n \n They include producing, directing, writing and other parts of filmmaking generally. If I have the chance, I would like to learn cinematography.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://punchng.com/i-skipped-classes-for-movie-auditions-tobi-makinde/"},

On December 6, 2019, which was my sister-in-law\u2019s birthday and the day she gave birth to her twin babies, I told myself that I was not going to write an epistle. Then, I was doing my Master\u2019s degree at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State. I did my research about twins\u2019 panegyric (oriki) and I went to mothers, who had nursed twins and are still nursing twins in my neighbourhood. I asked for twins\u2019 eulogy, I got some and I also went online to get more. I sat down and memorised them and I came up with my own tune of chant and did a video. The video went viral; some of their friends gave me money, while others started requesting for their lineage praises. I didn\u2019t turn any of their requests down; instead, I did more research. That was how I started my chanting business.\n The biggest gig I have handled was when I received a call from a real estate company\u2019s boss that I should eulogise one of his colleagues. It was a dream come true for me and I performed excellently.\n \n Well, it was quite rewarding because it was a six-digit amount. \n We live in the era of social media, so I use social media to my advantage.\u00a0 I advertise on Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp.\n What are the \n I face challenges with clients. Some clients would not give out information until the day of the surprise (gig), while some would delay me and my team for more than four hours before we could perform. I usually get flimsy excuses for delaying my performance. However, all these do not stop me and my team from remaining calm.\n \n I have passion for my business and that is what has kept me going and still going, though survival instincts cannot be erased. But the passion keeps me going and I am maximising it\n People are now embracing entrepreneurship unlike in the past because some people do not have a choice. Entrepreneurs are born with the spirit. For others, it is because of insufficient job opportunities. Also, sometimes, it is an idea that makes entrepreneurship unavoidable. Unemployment is also an important factor that cannot be overlooked.\n \n Yes, there was a time I felt like quitting the business because a lot of people are now into it, which spoils the business for talented people like us. Some chanters will chant for clients for free, so they can at least post a video on their statuses and social media platforms. Hence, some clients will expect the same from me and it is tiring.\n   One of my most memorable moments as a chanter was when I met one of my clients from the United States of America. She had been patronising me on Instagram. She told me she would be coming to Nigeria. She came on her birthday and my team and I serenaded her. She gifted me one of the latest Samsung phones and also appreciated me with some dollars. It was indeed a beautiful day.\n \n As an educationist, I would love to lecture in a federal university or work in a manufacturing company. \n I will first advise them to discover themselves. Self discovery is key. They should discover if they have passion and talent for it. Also, they should discover what to do to make them different from others.\n \n The most important lesson I have learnt is that man is the most difficult to manage among living things. As a leader, I have learnt to put band members in their place and also make sure my decisions stand. I also have learnt to manage business funds myself; not assigning such a vital role to anyone but myself.\n \n I have dealt with different customers by being patient. Patience is never enough because we are created differently and we also react to things differently. Patience is never enough.\n I have eight permanent employees and two contract workers.\n \n Yes, I became my personal trainer because I always source indigenous panegyrics from elders I come across in the course of my research.\n \n Yes, there was a time when people looked down on me because I chanted. According to them, illiterates are the ones who chant or they are people who are lazy and do not want to work for money.\n \n I have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Biochemistry from Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ogun State, and then I proceeded to the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, to obtain my Master\u2019s degree in Biochemistry. I specialised in toxicology. I will be going for my Doctor of Philosophy next year by God\u2019s grace.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://punchng.com/even-with-masters-degree-i-chant-for-a-living-yusuf/"},

The National Working Committee of the party met and has among other matters deliberated on the allegations of misconduct labelled against you as the National Youth Leader of the Labour Party.

According to her, it became very clear that over time, there had been \u201cseveral attempts made at undermining my office\u201d, the office of the PDP National Woman Leader.\n She said, \u201cThe most recent attempts were as follows: \nAt the flag off ceremony of the PDP campaigns in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on October 10, 2022, here, serious attempts were made to prevent me from addressing the PDP audience at the Uyo stadium. It must be stated here that it is a customary tradition in our party for the National Woman Leader and the National Youth Leader, to address rallies in conjunction with party candidates, party chairmen et al. \n \u201cUnfortunately, in Uyo, every attempt was made to prevent me from addressing party faithfuls. I was told that there was a clear directive not to allow me to speak to the crowd. It got to the ridiculous extent of these agents, calling on Senator Uche Ekwunife, to speak to the audience, on behalf of PDP women.  \u201cSenator Ekwunife was very embarrassed, but she was prodded to do it. Iyom Josephine Anenih, a former PDP National Woman Leader, drew the attention of some party leaders to this anomaly. It was then that I was reluctantly called to address the audience on behalf of the PDP women. This unfortunate development did not go unnoticed by party faithful, who found the whole drama very embarrassing and childish.  \u201cAt the PDP Kaduna rally on Monday October 7, 2022. At this event, the National Youth Leader was called upon to address the crowd on behalf of the PDP youths, which he did perfectly well, to the admiration of the populace. I was physically present at the event in Kaduna. I was even seated beside the National Youth Leader. But Nobody called me to address the audience on behalf of the PDP women. \n \u201cRather, the spectacle was a very ridiculous announcement calling on Dr. Baraka Sani (Director of the PDP Support Groups, in the Campaign Council), to address the crowd on behalf of the PDP women. The entire audience were surprised, mesmerised and confused. People started asking questions there and then. Many wondered why the National Youth Leader was called upon to perform his traditional and official role, while the National Woman Leader was deliberately prevented from doing hers. \n \u201cThere and then, some people tried to explain that unfortunate scenario in different colourations. While a lot of people found the occurrence very offensive, I smiled over the unfortunate incident in total sympathy with the perpetrators of such childish display of character.\n \u201cIt may interest you to know that the happening has gone viral, to the disgust of many Nigerians. Specifically, the Kaduna occurrence has seriously painted our great party in a negative light. Very, very sad indeed.\n \u201cWell, on this note, it has become very obvious that there are some distracting elements within our great party who are determined to frustrate me in the performance of my statutory duties as the PDP National Woman Leader. This is very unacceptable. May I state clearly here that I cannot and will never succumb to any unnecessary attempt to frustrate me, in the performance of my official duties.\n \u201cI will continue to perform my duties to the best of my ability and to the benefit of our esteemed party, within the confines of my safety and the tolerance level around me. \u201cThe purpose of this elaborate analysis, is to bring the attention of the members of the PDP National Working Committee to these strange developments happening around my office and by extension my humble person. May God Almighty touch our dear hearts in order to enable us critically assess and act upon this unholy and isolated attempt at massive victimisation and marginalisation of my office and my humble self.

Defending his action in a media parley\u00a0 on Thursday, Adamu disclosed that the move was necessitated by the need to sanitise the system.  This is even as he denied allegation that the new replacement were his cronies.\n He said, \u201cThat the report is false.

We had a bill of N7.7bn to settle on legal matter alone. We came to find that here everybody was like me, on his own. No control, no system, no due process. Everybody doing what he wanted to do. It is just because you don\u2019t want to be accused of anything that you will allow that kind of people.\n \u201cMy DNA has terrible allergy for that.

In a statement issued in Abeokuta Wednesday morning and signed by the Publicity Secretary of Ogun APC, Tunde Oladunjoye, the party explained that it was seeking the discontinuation of the suit owing to the fact that INEC, who was the first defendant in the suit, had complied with another judgement of the same Court by refusing to recognise Adebutu and Akinlade as candidates of the PDP. The Suit No. FHC/AB/CS/149/2022 APC v. INEC & 3 Ors was earlier instituted against Ladi Adebutu and Akinlade when their names were initially published as governorship and deputy governorship candidates respectively. However, by the judgement of the Federal High Court in September, Adebutu and Akinlade were removed as governorship candidates of the PDP in Ogun State. INEC wholly complied with that decision and when it published the national list of candidates on October 4, 2022, did not publish any names for the PDP. Even at court sitting of 13 October, 2022, the PDP withdrew its motion to stay the execution of the Federal High Court judgment removing Messrs Adebutu and Akinlade. In doing so, the PDP acknowledged and the court ruled that there was nothing to stay any long since INEC already complied with the order and the PDP no longer has governorship candidates in Ogun State. The APC enjoins \u201cthe good people of Ogun State to continue to support the administration of Prince Dapo Abiodun that has been delivering good and unprecedented dividends of democracy across all sectors such as housing, health, transportation, infrastructure, agriculture, youth empowerment and social development. \u201cA disorganised, scattered and crisis-ridden party at the ward, local, state and federal levels like the PDP is totally unfit for Ogun State and cannot govern the Gateway State renowned for many firsts in different sectors of our national life\u201d, the statement said. \u201cThe PDP is like the Bourbons dynasty of France, they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing\u201d, the statement concluded.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/ogun-apc-withdraws-suit-against-inec-ex-pdp-candidates/"},
{"headline": "Obi, Tinubu, Atiku belong to same generation \u2013 LP presidential aspirant", "image_url": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/18205334/Joseph-Faduri.jpg", "author": "Segun Adewole", "posted_date": "19th October 2022", "description": "Speaking during a Twitter Spaces session, Joseph Faduri lamented that since Peter Obi emerged as the LP presidential candidate, he had excluded him and his team from the party\u2019s campaign strategy.\n He said, \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate what is happening to the Labour Party and Nigeria right now. The press conferences and press releases we have been putting out have been causing a lot of chaos across Nigeria. It is not our fault. Obi and the LP brought this on themselves. They had five months to resolve this matter but chose not to resolve it. I am not a man that is being used by anybody or any party. And also, my team, Rescue Movement, can never be used by any political party.\n \u201cWe are an independent and young generation that wants something new in our country. We want a country that can work for everybody. Obi belongs to the same generation of the Atikus and the Tinubus that we are saying that we don\u2019t want but politics was played in Asaba and he claimed the ticket of the party. After that, we expected that he would show leadership but he never reached out. He never lent a hand of fellowship. He never brought us to the fold. He actually excluded us (my team and I) from everything he had been doing. \u201cA great example is the campaign list that just came out. No input was requested from us to say, \u201cOkay, Father Joe my fellow contestant, these are things we need to do. Alright, if there are 10 or 20 people that can serve from your side, this is about service to our nation. So, bring them in and let us add them to the list. No single soul from our team was added to that campaign list.\u201d\n Faduri said what Obi would do as a leader in the future would be determined by how he handled the current crisis in the LP.\n He said, \u201cWhat he did when he was governor, I wasn\u2019t there. His own people would have to be the ones to judge that. I cannot judge him. I cannot talk about his record. I can only say what he would do by judging what he\u2019s doing now, how he\u2019s handling the crisis and how he\u2019s handling leadership. When you become the flag bearer of a party, you become the leader of that party. So, as far as our party is concerned, he\u2019s the leader. So, what it means is that if there are aggrieved people in that party, it is his duty as the leader of the party to bring them together and say let\u2019s come together. What are we fighting about?\u201d Lamenting that his team\u2019s effort in the LP was hijacked, Faduri said Obi joined the party after discovering that he couldn\u2019t outspend former vice president Atiku Abubakar in the presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n \u201cWe came together and we agreed to disagree but we had one focus, which was that we were going to have a new Nigeria void of corruption, void of poverty and void of everything that had been wrong with our country in the past years. So, along the line, we woke the Labour Party up and started pumping money into every aspect of the Labour Party, left, right and centre. In every state and every part of the country, we were on national TV, in national newspaper publications and campaigning with flyers and billboards.\n \u201cWe were doing all of this, spending millions of naira and visiting royal fathers from the north to the south. It was just four days before the primary election when Peter Obi dumped the PDP and saw a viable party that he could come and hijack. I\u2019m so disappointed today by so many people who are shouting \u2018Obi no dey give shishi\u2019 because I know how much Obi brought to the Labour Party. He could not outspend Atiku in the PDP and he came to the party to outspend me,\u201d he said.\n He further stated that after he was \u201cforced to step down for Obi,\u201d the party\u2019s promise to refund the money he had spent so far was yet to be fulfilled.  \u201cUp till now, no dime has been returned to me. I begged them\u2026 let me run in that election and lose. I would prefer to lose honourably than for you to force me to step down. Because if you force me to step down, then you will refund every penny I\u2019ve spent. And they said yes,\u201d he said.\n He went on to reveal that Obi\u2019s campaign team had been trying to divide his camp and steal his loyalists.\n \u201cI also saw Mr Peter Obi\u2019s campaign team using divide and rule to reach out to some of my team members and use them as coordinators without reaching out to the principal. That is what we call divide and rule. Divide them and pick some people from his team to use them. But I have good people. Even when they were working for Peter Obi, a lot of them were still loyal to the cause because they know what happened, they know how we are being treated,\u201d he said. He said he could not trust Obi, adding that he had yet to see leadership in the former governor.\n \u201cIf I cannot trust a man that I want to follow; how am I sure that when he gets there he will be the Messiah that we are all saying he\u2019s going to be? That is the question. If a man cannot keep a promise, cannot keep an agreement, cannot show leadership and settle this matter within the five months that I have reached out; even some prominent political leaders in Nigeria reached out; I can\u2019t mention their names. So, I have tried, exhausted every means to resolve issues and moved on to see how we can win this election but every effort I made was jettisoned by Mr Peter Obi and his team. It left me with no other choice but to come out. I\u2019m not coming out to persuade anybody not to vote for him. I\u2019m only coming out to say that I have not seen leadership traits in Mr Peter Obi. My personal opinion does not affect other people that will vote,\u201d he said.\n When told by a contributor that the Obidient movement enjoyed by the LP was because of Obi, Faduri reminded the audience that the movement metamorphosed from the   movement, which existed before Obi joined his party.\n He said, \u201cThe movement that is happening now is not an Obi movement but that of the Nigerian people and the movement started with #EndSARS. Let me put it that way. Nigerians were already tired and said in this election, they were going to do everything possible to do something different than vote for APC or PDP.\n \u2018\u2019So, that movement was already on the ground. During the time that we were doing primaries, the news was more on the APC because they had about 50 aspirants. So, even if some of us appeared on TV to talk about anything, you only heard about APC and PDP. Don\u2019t forget that the same Peter Obi was once in the PDP and nobody was saying anything about him either. So, it wasn\u2019t that Obi came to the Labour Party and blew everything up. No, it was a movement of Nigerian people, especially Nigerian youths.\u2019\u2019\n However, Faduri said he was ready to work with Obi if only the party could reach out to him for the issues on the ground to be resolved.\n He said, \u201cI am still ready. I\u2019m still ready to work with him. I just want them to do the right thing. I want to checkmate them to do the right thing. I\u2019m not completely against Mr Peter Obi. I would simply pick him over Tinubu and Atiku but Mr Peter Obi needs to reach out and say no, young man, what are you going to do? I want to have a country. I want to have a beautiful country. But I can\u2019t have a country where a leader has not shown leadership. I cannot spend close to N200 million and you expect me to just keep quiet.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/obi-tinubu-atiku-belong-to-same-generation-lp-presidential-aspirant/"},

But the leadership of the Arewa Joint Committee dismissed the claim, declaring that the exercise was never intended to endorse any presidential candidate.\n \u00a0The Chairman of the Joint Committee, Mallam Murtala Aliyu, who is also the Secretary-General of the Arewa Consultative Forum, insisted at a media briefing in Kaduna on Tuesday that the interaction with the various presidential candidates was not for endorsement.\n \u00a0Aliyu explained that the exercise was part of a plan to generate a commitment to address the challenges of the region by candidates. \u00a0\u201cThese interactions, in themselves, were not planned to endorse a candidate.

First, they demonstrated the strong bonds of unity of the people of the North, represented by the collaborating groups and our unquestioning commitment to the search for the best quality of leadership among the many candidates who want our support.\n \u00a0\u201cSecond, they showed a commendable level of respect for the democratic process by the candidates who submitted to the process. \u00a0\u201cThird, they afforded Nigerians a rare opportunity to see and hear candidates speak about their plans and vision.\n \u00a0\u201cFour, they helped to focus attention on the peculiar and shared problems and challenges of the North and scrutinise the levels of understanding and sympathy for them among the candidates.\n \u00a0\u201cFinally, they raised the bar in our search for leadership that respects accountability and competence.\n \u00a0\u201cThese interactions, in themselves, were not planned to endorse a candidate.

Adamu in the letter alleged that Tinubu deliberately sidelined the NWC in the composition of his presidential campaign council.\n But hours after it went viral, the leadership of the APC distanced itself from the contentious letter.\n A statement issued in Abuja by the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Felix Morka, stated that the letter did not emanate from the party. The allegation came in the wake of the unveiling of a 422-man committee that comprised political heavyweights and other notable members to pilot the various sub-committees of the campaign council.\n The list of members released by Secretary of the Presidential Campaign Council, James Faleke, in Abuja, following a series of postponements and conjectures about those who would be saddled with the task of leading the ruling party\u2019s bid to retain power at the federal level.  The campaign council chaired by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has Tinubu and the APC national chairman, Adamu, as Deputy Chairman and Deputy Chairman II.\n However, the harmonised campaign list released on Wednesday night by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore, saw Tinubu sacrifice his position for Adamu as Deputy Chairman and took up the Deputy Chairman II position.\n A source within the PCC told our correspondent that the APC candidate chose to honour Adamu with the position to allow peace to reign.\n \u201cYou know the cold war between them has always been there long before the APC presidential primary ended. Adamu is always suspicious of any move that Tinubu makes and seeks ways to tackle it.\n \u201cEven the members of the NWC know Adamu doesn\u2019t hide the fact that he always wants to be made a key member of decision-makers to decide the direction of the campaign ahead of 2023,\u201d he said.

So, I will appeal to all sides to allow the BOT to settle the matter in the interest of all.\n What we need is a commitment to the party and the ability to sacrifice personal interests for the common good of the party, knowing that the party is on the brink of winning the election. \n The National Convention of the party is the highest decision-making body, and the constitution is subject to that national convention. If the national convention says they should throw open the contest, that is superior to what the constitution says.\n I believe that they\u2019ve asked that Ayu should step aside but you need a convention to come up with new leadership. What is complicated is that, even if Ayu steps down today, it is still the North that will take over from him.\n The only thing that happened is that there will be restructuring, which means everyone else will be swapping positions between the south and the north, and that is a monumental thing to do on the eve of the general elections. You know that that itself will have its fallout; the selection process itself will be another problem, and so more disputes will arise.\n So, I believe that the party took cognisance of that and toed the line of peace by appealing to the Wike group.\n \n Well, the issue of being just is subjective because, rightly, he feels that the issue is a just cause. What I see is basically because of the antecedents. According to insiders, Wike played a key role in either enthroning or dethroning the party\u2019s successive chairmen.\n It is believed that he was the one that enthroned Modu Sheriff; he is the one that enthroned and dethroned Uche Secondus, and it is also believed that he was the one that enthroned Ayu. So, with these antecedents, perhaps it raised the question of selflessness. But at no time will the party be subjected to the caprices of one person.\n We are hoping that the crisis will not get to that point. The party is working hard to resolve the differences with the Wike group. Disputes are normal, even in a family. You can hear Wike, Ortom, and others saying that they will remain in PDP no matter what is happening. So, it is our hope and that gives us lots of strength. They are not talking about walking away.\n As you can see now, there is a lot of peace for now and we are no longer hearing reactions and counter-reaction from both groups.\n \n Every party has its own crowd, and whether the crowd will translate to victory or vote is another matter, but I am very confident that no amount of crowd can overwhelm PDP in Delta.\n PDP is present in all the 25 local governments in Delta and over the years, has brought good governance to the state. If it is all about youths, this is the most youth-friendly government. Okowa has embarked on so many programmes that bring our youths out of the streets.\n PDP has enough youths to counter \u2018Obidient\u2019 youths. By all means, we are going to the field because each party is trying to convince the electorate that they are not strangers. We are going to the field because we have enough to showcase, especially under the Okowa-led government. Okowa has performed in almost all sectors: education, infrastructure, economy and others.\n Yes, I know that Obi is making waves because of the failure of the APC as a government and as a party. Remember the issue of EndSARS? That is a failure of the government. They have nothing of substance to campaign with.\n \n How many resigned? Only one resigned. I am a senior political adviser; I should know those who resigned from this government. As far as I\u2019m concerned, some people just want to draw attention to themselves. You can resign from any government if you are not satisfied but you do not have to sensationalise it to score a political point.\n The PDP in the state at the moment is divided, with some members with Oborevwori while some are with Edevbie. Don\u2019t you see it as a serious setback, particularly with the rising popularity of the APC candidate, Omo-Agege?\n \n Well, overpricing is part of politics but let me say that our dispute in PDP is a legal dispute. It is a family affair. The legal dispute was not based on the quality of our convention.\n It is the right of any member to approach the court, so that is not dividing us at all. Edevbie has the right to approach the court but that does not mean that the PDP is divided. \n Well, I am not aware of that and I cannot comment on the matter. I wouldn\u2019t know.\n \n As far as I am concerned, I don\u2019t have the facts on that matter. Ibori is our leader and Okowa is the governor and the leader of the party.\n \n We are very confident that PDP will get more votes as usual in the area. Let me tell you why: First, the Tompolo contract is well deserved. He has worked so well for the stability of the Niger Delta, and he can confront illegal oil bunkers and others. Secondly, Tompolo has not defected to APC, and the contract is not based on the party membership, rather it is based on competence.\n There will always be defections; there is always movement but no movement is critical enough to alter the way PDP votes in the area. \n I am an Ijaw man, and the leader of the Ijaw nation is Clark.

Adamu had on April 22 ordered the directors to proceed on a \u201ccompulsory annual leave.\u201d\n Although the former Nasarawa governor promised to run a staff audit, the result of the exercise which showed an over-bloated workforce was not implemented.\n Instead, the party chairman consequently set up an investigative panel headed by an ex-Governor of Jigawa State, Ali Kudu, to study the handing-over notes of the defunct Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. It was the fallout of the committee\u2019s recommendations that compelled Adamu to place the departmental directors and head of legal services on an indefinite suspension.\n In the last one week, the media has been awash with report of new helmsmen replacing four of the six axed directors.\n Defending his action in a media parley with newsmen on Thursday, Adamu disclosed that the move was necessitated by the need to sanitise the system.\n This was as he denied allegation that the new replacement were his cronies.\n He said, \u201cThat the report is false. The fact of the matter is, go through the secretariat, there is not one person since we came in here that is my blood relation. Not one, whether primary or part of my extended family.\n \u201cIt is a fallacy (that I have my people working here). In fact, when we came here, it was to reorganise and reconstitute the party. You don\u2019t see the party in a state of mess and look the other way just because you want to be decent and not offend anybody.\u201d\n While claiming that he met a cesspool of corruption, tardy staff and a register containing over 200 names including ghost workers, the APC chairman swore that it was not in his DNA to overlook such anomalies. He also swore that his action was done out of motivation to right the wrongs and not as prejudice as being speculated in the media.\n \u201cWe came and found the party where people are fixing all manners of things. We had a bill of N7.5bn to settle on legal matters alone. We came to find that here everybody was like me, on his own. No control, no system and no due process. Everybody doing what he wanted to do. It is just because you don\u2019t want to be accused of anything that you will allow those kinds of people.\n \u201cMy DNA has a terrible allergy to that. I am sure most, if not all, of my members in the NWC share in this. So we found the necessity to reorganise the centre and only God knows the extent of appreciation we probably have won. Of course, every situation of change has a victim of its own and ours is not an exception. And we didn\u2019t do anything with bias or prejudice. The main thing is the interest of the party.\n \u201cI know we will be abused and falsely accused but we are humans. I am not saying we don\u2019t make mistakes. But the fact of the matter is that there is nothing we have done deliberately just to promote our own interests. We don\u2019t do it. There is a lot of falsehood going on.\n \u201cRecently, we tried to introduce table payment. If you are a member of this chapel, you know we don\u2019t have 200 people working for us here. But if you go through the payroll, we are over 200 people. Who are they? How did they come up on their bill? What are they doing for us? Where are their letters of appointment? What condition of service do they have?\n \u201cYou don\u2019t, because you are afraid of negative media reviews, ignore this. People went to the market square saying we are arranging salaries but can\u2019t pay. That is very far from the truth. We met and paid some arrears when we came in. I don\u2019t have any qualms about this. We did everything in good faith,\u201d he said.\n  also reached out to the affected directors to get their reactions. An unhappy Salisu Dambatta, who was the former Director of Publicity in the APC, told our correspondent that he doesn\u2019t want to join issues with the party.\n According to him, it will not be good for the image of the party, especially at a time when the Presidential Candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has commenced his campaign.\n Former Legal Head of the APC, Dare Oketade, also told our reporter that the ex-director of administration was in a better position to relate their plight.\n He also believed their predicament was more of a witch-hunt than the flimsy allegation of corruption Adamu was trying to rope them with.\n When contacted, the emotional admin director, Abubakar Suleiman, told   that the whole drama looked like it was pre-arranged.\n Suleiman accused the Adamu-led NWC of failing to narrate their \u201csin\u201d before plunging them into \u201ccompulsory annual leave,\u201d an act that culminated in appointment of their replacements.\n \u201cAdamu lied. My brother, nothing went wrong. The secretariat was in good hands. What necessitated his decision was not known to us or anybody. It was an agenda. Nobody was indicted. I am sure you must have heard from others too. Nothing went wrong anywhere. \u201cAs directors, we don\u2019t approve anything. Our job was to implement,\u201d he bemoaned.\n Asked where the allegation of N7.7bn was coming from, he dismissed the idea, saying it was non-existent.\n He noted, \u201cNothing like that. Nobody is aware of the N7.7bn you said he talked about. No money was missing. There were also no ghost workers anywhere. Every staff you see at the secretariat there was duly engaged with letters of employment. At the time we left, the staff strength was about 211 workers.\n \u201cAll these talks of corruption and others must have been an after-thought, I am sure. All the suspension letter told us was that it was based on the recommendation of the committee set up.\u201d\n A copy of the letter written to them by the party\u2019s national secretary and made available to our correspondent indicated that they were removed as a result of the recommendations contained in the report of the Transition Committee Adamu appointed.\n The director of administration lamented that at the bottom of the letter, \u201ceach of us was wished well in his future endeavours.\u201d\n Despite writing the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and copying Tinubu, members of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, National Executive Committee and party chieftains, no action was taken, according to the director. A pensive Suleiman, however, concluded that they might consider litigation if all entreaties to reinstate them fail.\n This was as he reiterated that Adamu and the NWC lacked the power to recruit or disengage staff without the approval of the National Executive Committee of the Party.\n He said, \u201cThe power given to them by NEC then was only to organise primaries and national convention. They have acted beyond their remit by sending us on compulsory annual leave which is strange to the APC staff condition of service and breached the APC constitution by saying that they have removed us.\n \u201cAn Establishment Committee is the only body that can make recommendation to engage or remove staff of the APC secretariat. And even then, it can only become effective when or if the NEC approves. There must be genuine reasons for either recruitment or disengagement.\n \u201cOur dismissal has not followed any due process. It is unfair. You just don\u2019t go about tarnishing people\u2019s image. You were about the only journalist that called to verify the truth.\n \u201cI have put 22 years of service into this party through the whole transition and merger process from the AD. But what Adamu just did was to bring in his cronies and people to run things at the secretariat.\n \u201cIf he tells you his people are not working at the secretariat, he lied. Quote me anywhere. He has his people in positions of leadership including those he brought in as aides and personal assistants.

The coordinated attack took place at the venue thrice before security operatives finally repelled the hoodlums.\n A saddened Atiku had condemned the incident, saying the attacks on his supporters in both Zamfara and Kaduna States, which led to the death of a PDP member, were direct attempts to suppress his legitimate campaigns in the states.\n Reacting to the ugly incident in a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday, National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Felix Morka, said the PDP had itself to blame for the attack. Morka stated that the ugly event that unfolded at the rally in Kaduna was wrong but, regrettably, self-inflicted.\n He disclosed that as a Party, the APC abhors and condemns all forms of violence and interference in the activities or events of any political party.\n According to him, every Party has a right to equal protection of the law, adding that perpetrators of disruptive and other acts of violence must be brought to justice.  The statement partly read, \u201cHowever, the PDP has no one but itself to blame for the violent incident at its rally in Kaduna. The incident was simply a matter of a rented crowd that went irate when the Party\u2019s rent-a-crowd managers disappeared with funds meant to pay for the rented crowd.\n \u201cRather than hold its head down in shame for the poor and distasteful showing at its Kaduna rally, the PDP seeks to scapegoat our Party for its own gross acts and misconduct.\n \u201cTo be clear, the APC has no hand in the attack as irresponsibly alleged by the PDP. We have no reason to be perturbed by the rally.\u201d\n Continuing, Morka noted that, as Africa\u2019s largest political party, bolstered by the accomplishments of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), with a vibrant future led by their Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the APC cannot in any way be unnerved by any political party. He also blamed the PDP for scheduling and conducting its rally in Kaduna on the same day that Tinubu was scheduled to make an appearance at the Arewa Dialogue.\n According to him, a mature and well-governed campaign would have avoided that apparent conflict of having two major events take place in the same city on the same day.\n \u201cHaving made their pitch at the dialogue, it was only fair that our candidate be allowed to do the same. But such civil gesture is uncharacteristic of the PDP.\n \u201cGiven the credible, free and fair elections that the APC-led administration superintended in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun States, there is no iota of doubt that our party remains committed to the highest levels of civility, transparency and respect for the rule of law in its political engagements. That this government also midwived the massive reform of the Electoral Act, and introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) speaks volume to its commitment to democratic consolidation in our country.\n \u201cWe urge security agencies to probe the unfortunate Kaduna incident with a view to unmasking and prosecuting the culprits behind it.\n \u201cIt is imperative that political parties eschew violence and play strictly by the rules of engagement, going forward. We enjoin all parties and candidates to subscribe to issue-based campaigns and observe applicable ethical standards and best practices. We owe Nigerians a duty to ensure a violence-free and peaceful electioneering process ahead of the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/atikus-rally-disruption-wrong-self-inflicted-apc/"},

Those are my few engagements so far. Coming into politics has always been a passion for me since I was young. I realised that one of the most important ways to improve people\u2019s lives, especially in a democratic era, is through political participation. I grew up with it and saw it as a means of understanding people and providing a better life for them. So, for me, politics is not just a thing I got involved in as a mere passion, it\u2019s also a way of meeting people and helping them turn whatever bad situations they were in to better ones.\n \n My interest in politics, especially as it relates to contesting for elective positions, has always been there over the years. But I was able to make up my mind and get into the ring in 2019 when I contested the state house of assembly, though I didn\u2019t go all out to achieve that purpose because there was an understanding over where that position would go at that moment, and now I have also shown interest in the Senate race in the Western Senatorial district, as you can see. Lokoja is one town that should look like a state capital. Even though some of us have visited other state capitals, we have seen how beautiful and well organised they are. If I have the opportunity to represent the good people of Kogi West, I will work towards ensuring that we have a city that resembles other capital cities. It\u2019s going to be service and quality service to the people.\n \n First and foremost, I want to condole with the families of those who lost their lives in that unfortunate and barbaric incident carried out by the hoodlums. May their gentle souls rest in perfect peace!\n For me, I think it\u2019s becoming a recurring phenomenon in the lives of our people that we have lost it security-wise. We have gotten to a stage where if we are not careful, it might lead to a situation where each and every one of us might be forced to defend ourselves because the assurance that you will be secured and protected in the situation of today is not there.\n What is happening today has shown clearly that the leadership needed to achieve this is not in place to address the security challenges. Having said this, we should look up to God and look at leaders whom we think can do the job and should be given the chance in the next election to be in office.\n \n Insecurity is something that all of us have to put our hands on deck to achieve the desired results; it\u2019s not something that should be left to the government alone. What you have come to understand about the issue of insecurity is that people also keep quiet. Sometimes it\u2019s not enough to blame the government; we also have a role to play in securing our environment by passing information to the police and relevant authorities. So for me, I don\u2019t want to lay all the blame at the doorstep of the government; people also have to be on alert. The police are human beings. Then again, I will also advocate that we should deploy more technology because human errors are becoming too obvious. If modern technology is capable of seeing before they happen, it will go a long way to addressing the human errors that have led to intelligent failures.   At what level are we restructuring? We must be very clear on the area we want restructured because if we do not specify, as long as the law remains the same, I don\u2019t think anything can change without properly identifying what area is restructuring and getting the right system that can work for you.\n From the federal to state and local levels, it\u2019s the same government. If you want to restructure, you have to identify what area or whether it\u2019s the whole system that needs to be touched. The whole issue of restructuring is getting confusing without proper distinction. People don\u2019t really know what they are trying to discuss in that context, so for me, I don\u2019t have much to say. All I know is that it\u2019s going to be a holistic discussion from all quarters.\n \n We are not practising what we preach. If we do, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to have a presidential system of government. We borrowed that system from America. It\u2019s working for them. If we borrowed it from there, why can\u2019t we practise it the way it is being practised over there? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the system of government we run that is the issue; it is that we should also be sincere about whatever system of government we are adopting. Yes, it has its flaws, but it is going to be an advantage for us if we practise it. Everybody will probably enjoy it. For me, it\u2019s not about the system; it\u2019s about the leadership. Stop cutting corners and start running the system properly.\n \n This time, it\u2019s not about the party; it\u2019s about the people who desperately want a break from the old order, who want to change the narratives. What makes the so-called bigger parties bigger are the people, so if these people also get the determination to align with NNPP, it will stop being a small party and become the party of the people. So it\u2019s not about being old or new. If the people choose to move with the party, it will become the people\u2019s party. It\u2019s whether they are ready to accept it and whether they have demonstrated their willingness to accept it at the moment. \n If you look at it, I think we should also move away from the issue of religious consideration. Let\u2019s just move on and build Nigeria. Let\u2019s begin to play the politics of unity and progress and not the politics of tribe or religion. Whoever emerges, whether Muslim or Christian, as long as he can deliver, he should be allowed. My kind of politics is that if you want to build Nigeria, irrespective of tribe or religion, that is what you stand for, and I think that\u2019s their business. If Nigerians want it or God wants it, so be it.\n As far as I am concerned, my own presidential candidate is Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso, for whom I am praying and hoping that he will become the next president of Nigeria come next year.\n \n My wish and prayer is that my people from the Kaba/Ijumu/Yagba axis will understand that if Kaba/Ijumu and Yagba have produced in the last eleven years, and Yagba also, ordinarily, I don\u2019t think Lokoja should even struggle to get it. They should see this as a matter of right. Considering the fact that this thing has left Lokoja for sixteen years, it should automatically return without passing through any rigorous challenge. It will do no harm to anyone, it will be a win-win situation.\n By the time we are looking at the governorship position, we can sit down and discuss it. So we should not be dragging this thing as far as Lokoja/Koto-Karfe is concerned. It can be given to us willingly without any dragging from our brothers in Kaba, Ijumu Yagba Federal Constituencies.\n On the style of Governor Bello\u2019s leadership,you know I was a member of the All Progressive Congress, APC until 2019 when I decided that enough is enough. This due to the prevailing culture of imposition and lack of internal democracy generally.

This is because Izzi LGA is one of the 13 local government areas of the state. We have our supporters and campaign office there.\n \u201cAs early as 6am this morning, I started getting distress calls. One of our coordinators there, called and said the Chairman of that local government warned him and said no meeting should take place in his local government and that he was under pressure from the government. The DPO also called and raised similar alarm that he was under same pressure and that we should not come.\u00a0\n \u201cI am the governorship candidate of APGA in Ebonyi State. I am in this race to govern everybody in the state. Therefore, if I can\u2019t go to Izzi, it means I\u2019m not qualified to run for the election. And that was why I went there.\u00a0 \u201cWe were confronted by the Ebubeagu team (I don\u2019t know what to call them now). I don\u2019t know whether they are government militia or terrorists. They shot at one of our cars. You guys can see it right here shattered. And we went there with official security men- the Department of State Services and the police, and our full campaign team.\u00a0\n \u201cThat\u2019s the latest development. They have taken the war directly on us and we want to let the world know what\u2019s happening here in Ebonyi State. This is our state, nobody is a stranger here. They have declared war on us. We are not cowards; we are not fools. This is undemocratic.  \u201cHe (Umahi) can\u2019t force anyone on Ebonyi people. Ebonyi people have the right to make choice on who becomes their leader. This is not how to run democracy. We have rights to reach out to our people. I have four local government areas- Ezza South, Ezza North, Ikwo and Ishielu. Will Francis Nwifuru come there to campaign with this kind of behaviour?\n \u201cSo, we are putting this out to the public, for them to be aware that this is what has happened today. Thank God nobody was injured but we have sustained gunshots injuries on our cars. This is why we thought it wise to address the press this afternoon. From here, we are going to lodge a formal complaint at the Ebonyi State Police Command. After that, we are going to another local government and we hope they (the Ebubeagu) meet us there.\u201d\n He added, \u201cIn Ezza South, last week, they confronted us there. Two days ago, we were inaugurating our support team, they were also there. This can\u2019t be the way to get into Government House. This is not the way to do it.\n \u201cYes, of course, we met our supporters in Izza. But our office was under luck and key. They had come before our arrival and chained the office. However, we met our supporters outside the office and addressed them. There are video clips of this incident today. Dr. Laz Eze was on ground and he did live coverage of the incident. Look at the shattered SUVs and these are gunshots.\u00a0\n \u201cMy advice to Ebonyians is, this is our state and we will not run way from this state for anybody. We will stay here. The only thing that will stop this kind of situation is people rising to face it squarely. \u201d When contacted, the State Police Command linked the development to political rivalry.\u00a0\n The Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Garba Aliyu, stated this in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Thursday.\u00a0\n He said, \u201cAttacked for where? I have just spoken with the APGA governorship candidate. It could be political rivals.\u00a0\n \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it now.

He recalled Buhari\u2019s regime as a military junta ruler who introduced many decrees that encroached with impunity on people\u2019s rights, a move that he said lacked any economic blueprint.\n He said, \u201cThat is why the Labour Party is surprised that those who foisted Buhari on Nigerians for the second time instead of burying their heads in shame still want to elongate Buhari\u2019s (regime) in office by continuing his anti-People\u2019s policies\n \u201cThe party is amused that the Candidate is not also proud of Buhari\u2019s achievement that it no longer campaigns with it but prefers to use his so-called achievements in Lagos to deceive Nigerians again.\u201d Arabambi reminded Tinubu that Lagos was just one entity out of the 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, adding that Nigeria as a whole was greater than the intellectual capacity of someone whose academic background, state of origin and paternity have been shrouded in doubt and secrecy.\n He noted that although it was not in doubt that the APC candidate created some jobs as former governor of Lagos State, questions needed to be asked about the kind of Jobs he created for the masses when his cronies and families had shared the plum jobs among themselves.\n The LP image-maker consequently warned Nigerians not to risk allowing the \u201chawk to feast on our commonwealth again.\u201d  \u201cFor the Labour Party, this is time to usher in breath of fresh air, someone with a touch of gold who can reverse the misfortune of Nigerians in the hands of kleptomaniac leadership.\u201d\n The NNPP presidential campaign council spokesman, on the other hand, disclosed that the majority of Tinubu\u2019s promises in the manifesto are unrealistic.\n Johnson said it was a proven fact all over the globe that governments could not provide enough jobs for their populace, especially with the current disruption in the entire world.\n This was as he contested that all through Tinubu\u2019s tenure as a governor of one of the richest states in Africa, he failed to either develop or nurture any research and development centre to breed innovations and start-ups. The mouthpiece of the NNPP Presidential Candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, disclosed that it was high time Nigerians began to hold their leaders accountable for all their failed promises.\n He said, \u201cFor example, what\u2019s the government going to do to manage the supply chain? We should be concerned about how the government can create an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive and sustainable job growth will come.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s his clear path to start exporting when Nigerian-made goods and services are far more expensive than the ones made outside the country because of high-cost of production.\n \u201cInfrastructure should be done by the government as basic and on a transparent PPP (Private Public Partnership). However, it must not be like the Lekki-Epe Expressway model which is exploitative.\n \u201cThe current flooding in the country can provide over 70 per cent solutions to enable agricultural revolution especially in the entire northern Nigeria (as in all year round growing and production of crops).\n \u201cThe APC government (federal, states and local) are known for increased taxes and levies.

When senators are running for extra terms, do they vacate their offices? That is how I am as well.\n Of course, I have confidence in INEC because they are the ones handling the elections. From my interaction with them, they are quite organised and focused. I have no reason to doubt them.\n \n Not at all; you have to understand that this period is like a marathon race. The INEC programme is different from the previous ones. From the previous programmes, they had only about three months to campaign and this one, you have like about six months. You know the times are hard for Nigerians. If you look at it from the perspective of the political party of the candidate, logistics is quite heavy. I believe that those who have not unfolded their manifestoes are equally more than ready. It is just that there are phases of campaigns, but I can assure you that in a matter of a month or two, the manifestoes will be unfolded. \n It is in the wisdom of the Senate not to stop anybody from the appointment, but I think if you look at it critically, we are all political animals. It is always difficult to see a Nigerian that is non-partisan. Yes, there are people who are card-carrying members of parties, but those who are not card-carrying members of parties are even more partisan. Perhaps, that is the thinking of the Senate, but I am sure that the Senate has its reasons. By their own assessment, if the lawmakers discover that the person is credible, equitable and trustworthy; they will be able to ensure that he or she does not in any way become partisan or favour any individual against another. I think they believe that there is no 100 per cent perfect way you can assess an individual mindset, whether card carrying member or not.\n \n I am sure he could have done better in the area of security more than any other area. If you look at him, his background; being a military officer, which was why he was supported across the board. Like he promised, he should not have allowed the issue of insecurity to escalate. But I am sure that Buhari would have loved to see that the issue of insecurity is taken care of as no one would like to come to a situation and then leave it worse than he or she met it. This is the scenario that is playing out now. Moreover, for the North that suffers more than any section of the country in terms of insecurity, Buhari will not be happy with himself. It only tells us that leadership is a collective responsibility and unfortunately for him, he appointed those that do not share in his passion of what he believes in. He has to rely on others for support and those that he is relying on refuse to live up to expectation.\n \n This is not so because there are many things that would have been addressed more frontally. It would have served as a warning to others who perhaps are doing what they are doing today. Look at the case of the Attorney-General of the Federation; look at the case of what is going on in the oil and gas region etc. and not much has been done to demonstrate that the administration is very serious in fighting corruption. I am sure too that the President is not happy in this area. What he needed to do was to show example by punishing those who went against the law.\n The peace accord has a moral sword, which will of course influence the attitude, action and even utterances of the people picking the number one office irrespective of the calibre and the personality of the people behind the peace accord itself.\n \n Insecurity is not peculiar to Nigeria alone, there are also some countries battling with the issue of insecurity such as Syria, Afghanistan etc. But they still conduct elections because the belief is that once an election is conducted and perhaps a new leadership emerges, that may be the solution to insecurity. That is why whatever it takes, the security agencies have not come out to say that they cannot contain the situation. If you ask them, they will tell you they are prepared to ensure that an election takes place.\n \n Well, the outcome of an election is supposed to be a reflection of what the people of that country are saying or what they want; if they are satisfied with the status quo and if they are not satisfied, the only way they can change it is through an election. To me, the way insecurity will affect the election will be a referendum on this administration as far as insecurity and the economy are concerned. The way security will affect the election will tell the world that Nigerians have either resolved to fight insecurity or perhaps change the government. Whatever Nigerians have been talking about the All Progressives Congress, we will see it manifest on Election Day.  \n The campaigns must be different and issue-based. They must touch on issues affecting Nigerians. People who are parading themselves as candidates, especially those from the major parties, lack the knowledge of how to move the economy of this nation forward. You cannot vote for someone who does not know anything about the economy, especially the key sectors of the economy because today, if you look at it, the most devastating drawback that Nigeria is facing is corruption in the oil and gas sector. This set of people does not know how that sector operates. If you do not have the knowledge of how the oil and gas sector operates, how do you stop crude oil theft? How do you tackle the issue of fuel subsidy? These are the issues the economy is dealing with now. I have worked in that sector and know how to move the economy forward through the introduction of international best practices that are available, which is something we can do. So, unless we have a leader, who understands the workings of that sector, which contributes about 90 per cent of our revenue and it has dominant backward and forward linkages with other sectors of the economy. The only reason why we cannot make enough revenue is because what we make is being stolen. The little that is left is being stolen by international communities and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited in the name of fuel subsidy. The country is being burnt at both ends. We must have a person who can handle Nigeria\u2019s issues and set the economy the way it ought to be.\n \n The problem of this country can easily be solved if as a nation we are able to distance ourselves from these dichotomies that have nothing to do with leadership. What has religion, ethnicity or zoning got to do with the capacity, competence or qualification of a person leading the country? So long as we cage ourselves in this sentiment, we can never make any progress, and that is why we are where we are today. It deprives us the opportunity of getting quality, informed and capable hands to run the affairs of this country. That is why my candidature is different from others. If you look at it, Nigeria today is being divided along ethnic lines. The Igbo have Peter Obi, Yoruba have Bola Tinubu; and the Hausa/Fulani have Atiku Abubakar and Rabiu Kwankwaso. If any of them wins, the other two ethnic groups will feel they have lost, which is why we cannot have a stable government going forward, because it is a competition among these three major tribes. This is why we are where we are today. If a Yoruba man wins, an Igbo man will be restless and vice versa. I am from the North-Central and I have the experience, purpose, qualification and knowledge, and I think for us to unite this country, the candidature in other zones should be given a trial and not to be sentimental such as judging the kinds of clothes the candidate is putting on, his faith, belief etc.\n \n Nigerians should understand that they cannot be doing the same thing the same way and expect different results. They should vote for people like me who are in the contest, and we have what it takes. We keep recycling people who have failed woefully. One of the biggest problems in Nigeria is that people who have put themselves up for elections are people who represent the failed establishment. We are now looking at how we can make the country work again. This cannot be done with people that have nothing to offer. What they know is that they are People Democratic Party, Labour Party, All Progressives Congress, or New Nigeria Peoples Party. Nigerians should break from that path that has not helped us in any way at all. With the coming of the ADP in 2023, the international communities will begin to take us seriously, because they will know that Nigerians have woken up from their slumber and they want to do things like the way other countries that are progressing are doing it.\n \n Well, that is not the solution, but where you have extraordinary problems, you apply extraordinary measures. The solution that other developing countries use to address oil theft should be adopted. The government should adopt a scientific solution where you have an online monitoring system to tell the government what is happening, how much the oil is producing and how much is being spent. The moment you have accountability and good governance, it goes a long way to track oil theft. \n I am not in the Labour Party and I will not like to talk about another political party as far as that issue is concerned. All I know is that Nigeria needs a change and the change we are looking for is not from establishment politicians such as Peter Obi, Bola Tinubu and others, who are making so much noise. They played key roles in putting us where we are today. That is not what Nigerians are looking for.\n \n As the Chairman of IPAC, we are trying to see how we can bring, not only the Labour Party, but all other parties to the table whereby we can discuss the requirements for national or unity government regardless of who wins; other political parties will also be carried along in governance using certain parameters. That is what we are working on. It is about all the political parties together. That is what we are trying to achieve as IPAC.\n \n You can also ask me why Tinubu is saying it is the turn of the Yoruba or you can ask me why Obi is saying it is time for the church to take back the government. These sets of people are ethnic champions and establishment politicians. They cannot solve our problems for us. They cannot grow out of that little space they are in as Yoruba, Igbo or Hausa. Nigeria is about everybody. Nigeria needs politicians like me who view the country as our world and not take tribe as our world.\n I will take decisive action on the issue of fuel subsidies that will improve the economy of the country. I will make sure that we do not borrow beyond whatever this government must have accumulated irresponsibly. I will also make sure that our naira exchange rate is a single rate and not multiple rates. I will make sure we have properly aligned monetary and fiscal policies. We will not have a central bank governor going to become agricultural, health or industry minister. The central bank governor, who is supposed to effectively supervise our monetary policy is now dabbling in fiscal policy. That is why things are upside down. My administration will not do that.\n My administration will ensure that corruption is fought, especially in the oil and gas sector. We will ensure that the essence of the sector is achieved. The essence of the oil and gas sector in Nigeria\u2019s economy today is to provide the resources we require to develop our educational, health, infrastructure and other key areas of the economy, which need development. We cannot keep borrowing when we have so much money and resources being stolen. We cannot be losing 80 per cent from our major source of revenue and somebody will say \u2018nobody is caught\u2019. You cannot have the Accountant-General of the Federation stealing billions of naira and nothing has happened.\n I will not print money; that is why we are having inflation today at 22 per cent for God\u2019s sake. Nigerians are being taxed 22 per cent of their incomes indirectly by the government that does not see the money itself. I will make sure that the standard of living in Nigeria is appreciably increased. We will be on the same path with the so-called developing countries by reducing the cost of living, tackling inflation and ensuring that we have employment at its best level by growing the sectors that will grow our economy. Believe me, Nigeria is like a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked. It is just that if you have people at the helm of affairs that do not have the knowledge of what to do with power, it is a disaster.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/atiku-tinubu-obi-are-ethnic-champions-sani-adp-presidential-candidate/"},

He said, \u201cThis Plan is not only a roadmap to a prosperous future, it serves as notice to the Nigerian people that, if elected, Senator Shettima and I shall work tirelessly to reach that promised future from the first moment of the first day we enter office.\n \u201cThe doors to security, prosperity and greatness are open to us. We must step through these portals, guided by a torchbearer with the experience and mettle to shoulder the task ahead. Nothing short of this will suffice.\n \u201cI seek to become the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria because I know the way. My experience and past performance assure that. It will be through collective effort and national endeavour that we join hands, cross divides, and achieve our vision,\u201d he said self-assuredly. An excited Tinubu told the audience that his campaign roadmap was borne out of interactions with Nigerians whose needs and aspirations he shared in the course of travelling across the country.\n This is even as he promised to consolidate on the gains of the president once they are elected into office.\n \u201cBased on the foundation established by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, we shall build a Nigeria where sufficient jobs with decent wages create a better life for all and a future of promise for our youth.\n \u201cWe shall revive our manufacturing industries and place Nigeria back on the path of industrialisation and job creation as well as to generate, transmit and distribute sufficient, affordable electricity to give our people the necessary power to drive their businesses and brighten their homes. Power is key to unlocking the potential of our national economy.\n \u201cWe also look forward to delivering food security and affordability by continuing to prioritise agriculture and assist farmers and other players in the agricultural value chain through enlightened policies that promote productivity and guarantee robust incomes.\n \u201cI ask you to join Senator Shettima and I on this journey. We have traversed every part of our nation, listening to the concerns and yearnings of Nigerians for a more prosperous and equitable society \u2013 better able to acknowledge and nurture the dreams of her people. We share the peoples\u2019 desire for a peaceful Nigeria where we all coexist in fairness, prosperity and with balanced representation in positions of authority,\u201d he said.\n He said he and his running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima, were more than ever ready to hit the ground running from day one if elected Nigeria\u2019s President. \u201cIt is, therefore, fitting that we are unveiling the Tinubu/Shettima Action Plan for a better Nigeria today.

Nigerians seek sustained progress and reform through stable governance and proven leadership.\n \u201cWe need true and innovative solutions that address the specific challenges of each of our 36 states and our over 200 million people. We need our own Miracle on the Niger River,\u201d he added.\n This, he said, his administration would achieve by building on the foundation laid by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. He added, \u201cBased on our unshakable faith in our people and standing on the foundation established by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, we shall build a Nigeria where sufficient jobs with decent wages create a better life for all and a future of promise for our youth, revive our manufacturing industries and place Nigeria back on the path of industrialisation and job creation\n Meanwhile, President Buhari has said that the APC-led Federal Government has \u201dmanaged to make Nigeria stable,\u201d laying a solid foundation for progressive growth despite socio-economic challenges facing the country.\n The president, while inaugurating the PCC as well as unveiling the Action Plan of the APC Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, pledged to be at the forefront of electing the former Lagos State governor as his successor.\n He affirmed that electing Tinubu would consolidate the achievements of his administration as the presidential candidate has the capacity, visionary leadership and track record to do more.\n \u201dIt will be disastrous to allow a situation that will lead to the reversal of the progress our country has made. Let me add that I joyfully accept the position of the Chairman of the campaign council we are unveiling today.\n \u201cOur candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is too well known for his capacity and can-do spirit.\n \u201dHe stands tall in his track records as a democrat, a champion of the rule of law, a man at home in every part of our country, and a truly visionary leader. All you need to do is think of Lagos in 1999 and 2022! \u201dI, therefore, want to assure all party members and supporters of our government that I will be at the forefront of this campaign.\n \u201dThis election is even more important than the election of 2015 that brought us into power. The cost of losing the gains our country has made is much more than the need to stop the haemorrhage that led to our coming together nearly nine years ago.\n \u201dI want to charge every member to put in all their efforts during the next four and half months of campaign to ensure we record a resounding victory in all our elections nationwide.

In the same list, the names of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara and Director General of the Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu were conspicuously missing again.\n More surprising were earlier names such as Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige; embattled Senator of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Chimaroke Nnamani; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola and former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, who were excluded from the fresh list.\n Their exclusion set social media on fire and got Nigerians asking questions about why they were suddenly excluded. There were new additions like Juju maestro, Sir Shina Peters in Creative Arts; Tinubu\u2019s running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima; Dr Mahmood Ahmed and Imman Ibrahim were drafted into Fund Raising Directorate while a war veteran, Major General Cecil Esekhaigbe completed the Intelligence and Security Directorate.  Efforts made to reach the Chief Spokesman of the APC Presidential Campaign, Festus Keyamo; National Publicity Secretary of the party, Felix Morka and PCC Director of Media and Communications, Bayo Onanuga, proved abortive.\n As of the time of filing this report, they neither picked the calls nor replied to the text messages sent to them.\n But midway through his speech at Friday\u2019s PCC inauguration, Lalong announced to the audience that the majority of members and party supporters who were dropped from the campaign list were given different roles to play at regional, zonal, state local government, ward and unit levels.\n While appealing to aggrieved members to remain calm and support the party, the Plateau State governor disclosed that the PCC composition involved a lot of consultations to ensure the party has a robust team that will capture all stakeholders.\n His statement read, \u201cThe PCC is aware that the composition of the leadership and membership of the various Committees may not have satisfied the yearnings of everyone.\n \u201cHowever, it is important to emphasise that everything possible has been done to come up with a list that captures virtually every interest. In addition, the structure outlined earlier will also give room for those whose names do not appear to be given roles at the Regional, Zonal, State Local Government, Ward and Unit levels. That way, everyone is captured in the campaigns. \u201cTherefore, we have carefully planned the structure to give roles to all members from the Unit, Ward, Local Government, State, Zonal, Regional and Federal Levels. That way, we are sure of not only getting everyone on board, but also able to easily track the roles played by each member in the campaign process. For the PCC, the days of people flying letters in Abuja while work suffers at the grassroots is over.\n \u201cThe PCC is elated by the zeal and desire of party members across the nation and the Diaspora to serve in one position or the other during the campaigns. That is why we carefully devised a strategy to ensure that everyone is captured across the various levels of the party structure. With the blessings of Mr. President and the endorsement of the Party and our Candidate, we have chosen to carry out a bottom-up approach to the campaigns.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/campaign-list-excluded-members-given-other-roles-apc/"},

He said, \u201cI stand here today to reject the Muslim-Muslim ticket just like I would have rejected a Christian-Christian ticket. It is not also okay to tell me and my team that while we rejected the Muslim-Muslim ticket, we should now turn around and vote for a politician of the same tribe as the outgoing president in this multi-lingual, tribal and racial nation.\n \u201cWe know what is lacking in Nigeria is knowledge and understanding that a Muslim does not necessarily need to become a Christian for us to live in peace, neither does a Christian need to become a Muslim to live in peace.\n What we need is an understanding of the two faiths. There are faiths aside from Islam and Christianity that we have also been interacting with. We need everybody. \u201cHaving examined all the candidates of political parties, we have come to the conclusion that the Labour Party has done the right thing for Nigeria by fielding His Excellency Peter Obi and Datti Yusuf. These are distinguished gentlemen who have proven themselves in leadership and management of resources in their previous endeavours.\u201d\n Kawaz, who have lived in Abuja for 24 years, reiterated that Nigeria was at a crossroad where the critical presidential election that will take place in a few months will either make or mar the country.  Muhammed also seemed to share his position when he disclosed that Nigerians should not regard the obnoxious Muslim-Muslim ticket as an option.\n He stated, \u201cWe have also made up our mind not to support any party with a Muslim-Muslim ticket because it was borne out of the selfish interest of one person. We support the motion for harmony and peaceful co-existence with our Christian brothers.\n \u201cThat is why we are also willing to go all the way to vote party with a balanced ticket. May God continue to help Nigeria and his people.\u201d\n While appreciating the delegation of clerics, the National Chairman of the Labour Party, Julius Abure, begged them to continue praying for the movement and safety of their supporters across the country.\n Abure lamented that a considerable number of their followers in different parts of the country have come under attack in recent times. \u201cSince I became the national chairman of the LP, today is my best day. I said so because the prayers from clerics of these two faiths are coming in the nick of time. The party and its followers are seriously under attack. Just yesterday, we are telling ourselves to go public by appealing to Nigerians and religious leaders to pray for us.\n \u201cThree days ago, the presidential candidate and his running mate were in Kaduna to attend a function. Our followers who came from Zaria were involved in an accident and died. Others are hospitalised as we speak.\n \u201cSince we started this movement, people thought it was a joke. Now they know. Today, they discuss no other things than LP in their closets. We are also receiving intelligence that they are going to fight us in some states where there are grand plans to attack our members. As I speak to you, they have invaded the homes of some members in Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Ebonyi, Enugu and several other states.\n \u201cWe know for sure that the time of the people has come.

It is an order, which seeks not only to protect the sanctity of our educational institutions, but also to preserve our schools for the benefit of end users of such edifices, who are children of school age. For those who believe in the welfare, well-being and future of future leaders, it is a regulatory act which time has come. \n The spirit of Order 21 speaks for itself. It outlines how anyone who wants to utilise facilities put in place in our schools, particularly for political activities, should proceed. It says politicians or political parties who wish to use school premises should approach the Commissioner for Education for the approval of such requests. It directs such applicants to make mandatory deposits, which will be required for the purpose of cleaning up and maintaining facilities, which may be damaged by persons who use them for other purposes that are not educational. I do not see how rational minds, and I am talking about rational minds, can infer for any reason that the idea is to muzzle political parties other than the PDP.\n The PDP is equally affected by the new rule. Nobody can be above the law. Our party, the PDP, the governor has said, is not exempted in any way from making payments for the use of such facilities. Against this backdrop, how can anyone say it is an attempt to stifle political parties operating in the state? It doesn\u2019t make sense. In the past, there have been instances where political parties clash over the use of venues. What Order 21 brings to the table, which people are afraid of talking about, is orderliness. \n Politics anywhere in the world gulps money. Political parties need money to spend to get out their messages in the media. They spend heavily on mobilisation, on security, transportation and other sundry issues. They even spend money on hiring thugs. Why will spending money on venues where people are expected to gather to listen to their messages and manifestos be a problem? The government may have thought it over before fixing the sum of N5m as the deposit. There are groups and alliances, which bring political parties together. I know that the PDP belongs to such groups as well. They can come together and engage the government to make adjustments through astute negotiations.\n   \n Those who know Governor Nyesom Wike will attest to the fact that he means what he says. The PDP will make those payments when the time comes. We will be willing to show evidence of such payments when the time comes. Name-calling and acts of blackmail will serve no purpose. The PDP will do nothing to undermine Order 21.  \n We have yet to launch out. When we do, we shall apply as a responsible political party. We shall do so in a very transparent manner, I assure you.\n How can an order, which seeks to regulate conduct and apparently ensure good behaviour, which strives to guarantee orderliness and remove skirmishes over the use of venues by rival political parties, be a recipe for violence? Those who are violent will seek avenues to show who they are. Laws are made to bring out the best in humans, yet there are lawbreakers to whom the existence of law is an affront.\n \n There is nothing in Order 21 that makes it draconian or undemocratic. The courts exist so that men can obtain justice. Those who wish to seek redress have the right to do so. Let me add that nobody has a right anywhere in the world to take the law into his own hands. Those who want to go ahead with their campaigns, who find grounds to campaign other than premises that are controlled by schools are free to do so.\n \n I don\u2019t. The reasons that I have so far put forward justify my posture on this matter.\n \n That is hogwash. For whom, aside from God, should we be afraid? We are ready for this election. We have a credible, competent, capable and God fearing candidate. Who decides who is popular? There is a danger in my view to confuse constituting a nuisance in the public with being popular. Sim is an accountant; so, he has a firm grip on those numbers that matter financially. Sim Fubara will keep Rivers money safe under his watch and ensure that funds, which belong to Rivers people, are used for their welfare, development and progress. Besides, Sim is the son of a soldier. This means he has an upbringing that has ingrained discipline in his heart and made love for state and country a must. He is a hard-nosed professional who understands what political economy means, who understands what investment means.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/parties-should-applaud-rivers-order-21-not-criticise-it-nwuke/"},

Governors in Nigeria are aware of their place in the determination of who gets what, when and how. Aware that they are \u201cPresident\u201d of their respective states, they spare no effort in demonstrating their near absolutism in the exercise of power and authority.\n At the height of the feud, which nearly cost them a second term in office, President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice-President Atiku Abubakar realised, albeit differently, how governors can make or break presidential ambitions. While a politically smarter Atiku with an eye on his boss seat had cultivated a healthy relationship with governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party; an indifferent Obasanjo with a bossy disposition towards the state executives had to quickly retrace his steps by begging Atiku on bended knees to perish his ambition. It was a lesson learnt the hard way.\n The victory of the All Progressives Congress in 2015 not only at the centre but in many states of the federation, offered a glimpse of hope that at least, governors would begin to act with a bit of moderation compared to the past. This was more so as the promise of change by the party elicited hope of the audacious type in the consciousness of many Nigerians. Since its formation in 2013, the APC has had as its national chairmen Bisi Akande, John Oyegun, Adams Oshiomhole, Mai Buni, Sani Bello, and the incumbent, Abdullahi Adamu. Apart from Akande, all others with the exception of Adamu, were forced out by high stake intrigues orchestrated by the governors.\n Pundits agree that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had to consult the APC governors before the party conducted its elective convention to pick Adamu as its chairman. With the statutory delegates ruled out for the convention, the governors had a big say on who got what in the National Working Committee.\n Back in their respective states, the governors wield their big influence to whip members of state assemblies in line after gifting them exotic cars, living quarters or both in most cases. In the end, separation of powers, a critical element of federalism, takes the back stage as lawmakers find it difficult to take a firm position against their benefactor governors. In the build-up to the 2019 general elections, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State showed the world how powerful a state chief executive could be in matters pertaining to party administration. Seen as a great financier of the PDP, the governor had worked behind the scene to ensure that the 2018 presidential primary was held in Port Harcourt, the state capital. A certain Atiku Abubakar had other ideas as he engineered a subtle campaign that could have seen the convention held elsewhere.\n A furious Wike, in response, vowed to \u201cteach the PDP a lesson,\u201d should the party settle for a city other than Port Harcourt. Not prepared for a backlash, the Uche Secondus-led NWC took the event to the Garden City to the consternation of millions of Nigerians, many of whom argued that the party ought to have ignored the threat by Wike.\n The crisis currently rocking the main opposition party is largely connected with state governors led by Wike, who believe that without their support, the PDP stands no chance of winning the 2023 presidential poll.\n Like Wike, governors Seyi Makinde, Okezie Ikpeazu, Samuel Ortom and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Oyo, Abia, Benue and Enugu states, respectively, have literally withheld their support for the party until the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, leaves his seat.\n Atiku and other chieftains of the party have met several times with Wike\u2019s camp, offered concessions and made promises, but the governors are adamant that only Ayu\u2019s removal will be good enough to see them return to the Presidential Campaign Council\u2019s fold.\n Huge financial sacrifices have been made flying top party chieftains to meet with the aforementioned governors all in a bid to resolve the crisis, but for Wike and his loyalists, a deal is not close until Ayu returns to his Maitama, Abuja residence in a forced or voluntary retirement.\n Some ex-governors are not left out of the sheer absurdity. The crisis that is brewing in the South-West PDP is partly informed by former governor Ayo Fayose\u2019s insistence that he be recognised as the leader of the party in the zone. Not prepared to have that, Makinde called his bluff, arguing that as a sitting governor, no one merited the honour more than him. It took close to a year for the party to regain a sense of direction when Fayose finally embraced the leadership of the Oyo State governor. Worth mentioning here is the widely reported fallout between the then APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. Once friends and allies, Oshiomhole handpicked Obaseki as his successor, but they soon fell out with the governor openly complaining of how he was not allowed to have a say in federal appointments coming to the state.\n With Oshiomhole succeeding Oyegun as the APC chair, it soon became glaring that Obaseki had to look elsewhere for a ticket if he was interested in a second term in office. The investment banker-turned politician was shocked when he was denied the opportunity to participate in the primary election of his then party, the APC, by the national chairman.\n In a rare show of uncommon solidarity, governors, regardless of party affiliation, lined behind one of their own, who had then crossed over to the PDP. In the election, Oshiomhole and the APC candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, suffered severe electoral defeat even in APC strongholds. Both men have remained in political oblivion, with their future now facing uncertainty.\n Following the composition of its Presidential Campaign Council, the APC has been engulfed in internal wrangling and Tinubu is now set to appoint more members to provide jobs for governors\u2019 boys.\n Speaking on the growing influence of state governors, Haruna Abdullahi, a member of the 2019 APC Presidential Campaign Organisation, said the state chief executives needed to realise that they were holding power in trust for the people.\n He stated, \u201cThey should know that they are in power for the sake of the people. They are not there because they are the most educated or influential. Every four years, they seek votes from the common man to become governors. They are supposed to use this power moderately. The fact that they are shielded from prosecution while in office is also an issue that needs to be addressed.  \u201cSome of them, who were very powerful yesterday, have had cause to answer questions on their stewardship. A few of them were found guilty and jailed. Those in office today should know that every new day is one day less of whatever is left of their tenure.\u201d On his part, a lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, said the excesses of governors could be checked \u201cthrough the well known principles of party supremacy and party discipline,\u201d emphasising that \u201cthe tail can\u2019t wag the dog and an agent cannot be greater than the master.\u201d\n In what is fast becoming a trend, governors who completed the constitutional two terms often see the Senate as their retirement home. Incumbent Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, is set to make a return to the Senate in 2023 with insinuations making the rounds that he has been offered the Senate presidency in the event of Atiku\u2019s victory.\n The travails of Senate President Ahmed Lawan has been traced to the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, who on realising that he had purchased the presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination forms, quickly got the barely known Bashir Machina to declare interest in the Yobe North Senatorial District seat. Lawan lost at the primaries to Tinubu and his attempt to make Machina act as a placeholder failed. After several efforts to reclaim the ticket proved abortive, including legal options, the Senate President recently accepted his fate.\n In his contribution, Asukwo Archibong, a good governance advocate and 2019 presidential candidate of the defunct Nigeria for Democracy argued that the weakness in the nation\u2019s democratic system largely contributed to the powers the governors boast of today.\n \u201cThe power of governors revolves round access to state funds and lack of accountability. Simply put, corruption and immunity gives power to governors. They tend to use state funds for electioneering purposes without facing any severe consequences. Because of the easy availability of state funds, they are generally thought to be able to deliver their states for their parties\u2019 presidential candidates,\u201d he stated.\n Archibong pointed out the many ways loopholes in the polity were being exploited by governors to their maximum advantage, saying, \u201cWith money, they also influence who is elected into the National Working Committees of their parties.\n \u201cThe withdrawal of a governor\u2019s support for a candidate in either an intra-party election or a general election can signal the end of the candidate\u2019s political ascent. In the current crises in both the PDP and the APC, the withdrawal of a governor\u2019s support can negatively affect the prospects of the party\u2019s presidential candidate in the poll,\u201d he added. A former Edo State Commissioner for Information and until recently a member of the PDP, Kassim Afegbua, told our correspondent that happenings in his former party were fallout of political treachery by a powerful figure, stating, \u201cThe PDP crisis is a product of injustice and political manipulation that gave birth to Atiku\u2019s emergence as the candidate. Today, the PDP is skewed against the South.\n \u201cThe presidential candidate, director-general of the campaign council, the chairman of the party and the spokesmen are all from the North. Meanwhile, the party is stronger in the South with nine governors than the North with five governors. The real cause of the PDP crisis is lack of internal cohesion, injustice, false promises, empty rhetoric, pretences and dishonesty on the part of those who are dictating the fate of the party.\u201d\n He commended governors elected on the platform of the ruling party for walking their talk in ceding the party\u2019s presidential ticket to the South, saying, \u201cThe APC, to the best of my knowledge, is not in crisis. The APC governors are talking of inclusion. That\u2019s fair enough. The fact that the APC governors recognised the need to cede the presidency to the South is enough reason for me to celebrate them. They are different from the man who says he\u2019s a unifier, but cannot unite his party. Isn\u2019t that ridiculous and contradictory?\u201d\n On his part, a political commentator, Jackson Ojo, said in the past, leaders knew their places in party administration, noting, \u201cWhat we had then was the supremacy of the party. The national chairman of the party was the leader of the party; the state chairman was the leader of the party in the state.\n \u201cThis particular political experiment we are going through now started in 1998 when Solomon Lar was the National Chairman of the PDP. The principle of the supremacy of the party was in place. Immediately former President Olusegun Obasanjo was voted for, he changed it. And that does not mean that it is reflected in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n \u201cSo, they changed it to the principle of the highest office holder of the party to be the leader of the party, meaning that the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the leader of his own political party. The state governors became the leaders of their parties in their own respective states. At the local government level, the chairman is the leader of the party.\u201d\n Ojo added, \u201cIn Nigeria today, what they call the governors\u2019 forum has given them undue influence and enormous powers such that they can even take on the President and dictate to him. However, the President is the Commander-in-Chief and national leader of the party even though the states have more power because without the states, there will be no President. They are the ones that control power at the people\u2019s level. \u201cWhen you look at it extensively, you will discover that there is no state today where a governor is not dictating how the local governments are to be run. The governors handpick local government chairmen and appoint an electoral committee, which will now dictate the outcome of the local elections.\n \u201cYou will discover also that the ward, local government and state levels are being controlled by the governors. So, by the time they come out as a united force, they can even frustrate the effort of the President. Nigerian governors today are more powerful than other governors across the world.\n \u201cThey are so powerful and there\u2019s nothing anybody can do except the National Assembly enacts a law that will put the principle of the supremacy of the party, which allows for the state chairman of the party to be the leader of the party at the state level. Before the switch in the system, a national chairman could sit somewhere and invite the President or any governor for questioning, but that cannot happen now. If the governors today are united in a bid to remove the President, they will do even more than the National Assembly.\u201d\n A chieftain of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Anthony Sani, is of the opinion that Nigerians must demand accountability from their leaders at all times. He said, \u201cGiven the nature of politics and how power affects ideals, how power affects people in power and also how power affects people upon whom power is exercised; the only way to check the executive power of governors is for Nigerians to make judicious use of their democratic rights and ensure that votes count so that the ensuing leaders will be accountable to the voters.\u201d\n As long as the governors continue to wield unrestrained powers, the parties on which platform they are elected will be at their beck and call. And until the parties devise means of self-funding, governors will remain emperors whose orders must be carried out to the letters by party leaders and supporters.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/x-raying-govs-overbearing-influence-amid-lingering-party-crises/"},

So, it is 18 months salary arrears and not 26 months. The resident doctors in the ABSUTH are owed 25 months.\n There have been protests on this matter. We have met with the government and other stakeholders on this issue. I joined several groups in the past, including the Nigerian Medical Association and that of critical stakeholders in the ABSUTH, and each time, we get promises that never get fulfilled. Mind you, the Health Management Board, the general hospitals, the doctors there are also old, they are owed about 13 months, and this September will make it 14 months.\n \n The resident doctors of the ABSUTH have been on strike since April last year. Currently, from what I have heard, the National Association of Resident Doctors, which is the national body, said they would ask their South-East members to join the strike, so that it will not just be this hospital. Of course, that will make more impact. But I don\u2019t know if they (resident doctors) will be pacified if they receive the seven months\u2019 salaries today (Tuesday). I am not a member of NARD; so, I wouldn\u2019t know. \n Many people who go to hospital don\u2019t really need the stamp; they just go to hospital to get their treatment and then go away. The issue of stamp comes when you need a medical report. The stamp helps to stamp out quackery at that level so that people use the stamp to identify who is a doctor, but most people in Aba, where I stay, don\u2019t mind; they go to where they think they will get the services probably cheaper. That is why quackery thrives. Don\u2019t forget too that some of those places we classified as quack centres may be registered hospitals. Let me give you an instance; a doctor may register a hospital with his name, and then for whatever reason, decides to lease it out. It is like all these people travelling to Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the US and other places. When the doctor does this, he may lease that hospital to be managed by somebody he probably calls an experienced nurse. Of course, you know that a nurse practising as a doctor is a quack.\n Also, some nurses may get a hospital and get some doctors to register it for them. The hospitals may actually be registered hospitals, but it is just that the person managing the hospital may not be qualified. Again, some people don\u2019t even bother registering. They just open it with any name \u2013 hospital, clinic. Some people also register as other establishments that are not really hospitals. An instance is a pharmacy. Even pharmacists sit down in their offices and somebody comes to ask for medicine for high blood pressure, they will prescribe drugs for you. That is another form of quackery because for now, the law establishing pharmacy does not allow them to prescribe drugs. So, if they prescribe drugs, it is another form of quackery. Even lab people too, when they carry out lab tests for people and they list out the medications and give prescriptions, it is a wrong practice. The issue of quackery is multifaceted.\n \n In the past, we have done a few things. There was a time when we caught a man who was working in a mission hospital as a doctor, but he was not a doctor. When we got the news, we got him arrested by the police and on interrogation, we found out that he had a certificate from the University of Port Harcourt, but he confessed that he just took his friend\u2019s certificate to an artist, who duplicated the document with his name on the certificate. Then I was the state NMA secretary and not the chairman. So, we eventually got the police to take him to court. To be frank, I don\u2019t know how the case ended because the case was ongoing when we handed over to a new regime.\n \n Many people are not so much aware of monkeypox. Really, jingles are there, but I don\u2019t think the impact is like that of COVID-19. You can\u2019t compare the impact of COVID-19 campaign to that of monkeypox. In fact, some people don\u2019t even know what monkeypox is. The campaign is going on, but the impact is nothing compared to even the Ebola virus campaign; everybody was aware of Ebola virus compared to the knowledge about monkeypox. \n The public hospitals in Abia State are working. Members of staff are not on strike except members of the Association of Resident Doctors, which I talked about earlier. Apart from that, other people are supposed to be working. But the level of activities there is minimal; it is nothing to write home about compared to what it should look like.\n \n Yes, the issue of non-payment of salary is causing incessant strikes. Today, we are back; tomorrow, we are on strike. So, a lot of people have lost confidence in the system. I remember, as a surgeon, I wanted to operate on one man last year, the man told me that his fear was that I would leave him and embark on a strike, and that he preferred going to a private hospital. I told him that I would not abandon him or take him to any private hospital. If I meet a patient in the private hospital, I will take care of the person. So, I don\u2019t know what he finally did. He rejected the surgery on the grounds that we may proceed on a strike after the surgery.\n \n Well, I have not gone round the general hospitals, but the teaching hospital, where I work, has very good facilities. Of course, you can\u2019t describe it as being the best, but it has some facilities that if well utilised, they will go a long way to provide good services for the people. But the problem is poor utilisation; that is just the problem. Again, poor maintenance is another issue. When some facilities develop technical problems, they are kept in one corner and abandoned, and when accreditation is approaching, you see them looking for equipment that is not working and somebody to come and fix it. After accreditation, of course, the equipment will work for the first time, and once they develop issues, everybody abandons them again. So, poor maintenance culture has always been an issue.  Some of us, our private hospitals are far busier than government hospitals. Like a surgeon, you will discover that the doctor may carry out 100 surgeries in his private hospital in a year or 50 in a year, but in the government hospital, he may just do 20 surgeries. It is not because you as a doctor shied people away from doing surgeries, but because more people come to the private hospital. So, it is completely not true that doctors go on strike because they want to have the freedom to work in their private hospitals. The government should do their own beat and pay the people their salaries. Our Chief Medical Director has been saying that if you pay doctors and they are not coming to work, they will be sanctioned. So, you cannot owe somebody salary and you keep giving excuses.\n \n Yes, there was a day I was in a keke (commercial motorcycle) in Aba, from Bata to Ogbor Hill. As I was moving, I saw one of our staff members around the post office area and she was just trekking. Initially I wanted to stop and pick her since I was using a drop. On second thought, I said she might be doing something there. So, I went to where I was going, finished what I was doing there, which took me over 20 minutes. When I was going back, I saw the same person still trekking. When I stopped to ask her why she was trekking such a long distance, she said she didn\u2019t have money for transport. If the person faces such stress today, the following day, she will definitely be tired and not want to go to work. So, when people cannot take care of their basic needs because they are not paid, it becomes an issue.\n I was also with a doctor one time; he was around for accreditation. The wife called him, saying their only daughter had been sent away from school because her school fee had not been paid. The young man broke down and started crying. I just consoled him. When people are pushed to the wall and they are going on strike, instead of looking at the issues, somebody is trying to divert attention. The best thing is to pay them; they should pay them and if the person is not doing his or her work, then you sack the person or sanction the person through other means. Our members are really going through tough times because they have not been paid their salaries for months. I know sometimes, people start making calls to say they have not paid their house rent and their landlord is on their neck and they ask for a loan to complete the house rent. So, people are going through hard times.\n \n Honestly, he has not been found. So, he has officially been declared missing.\n He was kidnapped in June; we are talking about four months ago.\n \n I am not part of the people at the forefront of ensuring his release, but the little I know then was that at a point, I learnt that about three or four various security agencies; one directly from the state Commissioner of Police, another one from the DSS, then a special squad that reports directly to the Inspector-General of Police were involved. There were about three or four groups working independently to rescue him. At a point, the village, through the traditional ruler, sent out youths to comb the bush with the hunters. The mandate was to search for anywhere the doctor must have been kept. After searching, they couldn\u2019t find him. So, probably they might have moved out of that place at that time if they were actually in the bush. There was a call for ransom after he was kidnapped on a Sunday; I think it was N60m, then later, the family negotiated it to about N5m, which they paid by Monday evening. The kidnappers told the family to come and pick him somewhere. The family went there at night and waited till morning, they couldn\u2019t see him. That was when they raised the alarm.\n \n For now, I don\u2019t think we have any that has gone against the rules since I came on board as the state NMA chairman.\n \n It is not actually self-medication because there are practitioners who give them the drugs. They (patients) consult before they get the drugs. The highest level of self-medication is where you prescribe, procure and give yourself. The other mild one is when a patient is told to take a particular drug twice a day and the person thinks taking it three times a day will make it work more effectively. The patient is not strictly abiding by the doctor\u2019s treatment protocol. The patient is doing it his own way. If you look at the issue of African medicine practitioners or so, I cannot say it is self-medication because the patients go somewhere where they are given the medications. The only problem there is the issue of safety and dosage. Sometimes, they don\u2019t have (accurate) dosage. Again, most of their drugs do not undergo all the clinical trials that standard drugs go through, especially for safety. That is one of the reasons people think it is the reason for the increase in kidney failure. \n If I meet them, I will tell them that somebody who uses the same method to treat dislocation, fracture of the femur, fracture of the tibia, while in orthodox medicine, we have different methods of treating each of these conditions and you will get the total result. So, if you are sick, you should consult where you will get standard treatment, undergo tests first if need be before treatment, and go to get a particular medicine that will cure typhoid, ulcer and other diseases at the same time.\n \n The truth is that some people do refer, but they are in the minority because most are not involved in such acts. People go to functional public hospitals for some reasons because they are sure that for example, in a teaching hospital, all the specialists are there. The other reason is that it is generally cheaper there (public hospitals) than private hospitals. But people also have their reservations. If somebody comes to a private hospital, they will tell him to deposit N100,000. From that amount, they will start work until the money is exhausted. But in public hospitals, most of them don\u2019t do that. If they need a drug of N2,000, they will tell the person to go and pay at the pharmacy where they will give you the drugs. But because people queue up, it may take you 30 minutes of standing before you get the drug. So, some people don\u2019t want that, and that is why they go straight to private hospitals.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/abia-doctors-facing-hardship-over-unpaid-salaries-nma-chair/"},

That\u2019s also because we are conscious of the importance of women in politics because they are more committed, loyal, and the best mobilisers when it comes to campaigning. Whoever doesn\u2019t discover that early is headed for doom. We also know for a fact that women are hardly disloyal, unlike when we have flip-flops on the part of men. That is reflected in the kind of passion you saw on the day the women\u2019s wing was inaugurated at the State House.\n So, we thought the women should be given pride of place and inaugurated first. We didn\u2019t want to bury them inside the structure of a male-dominated campaign council. Besides, this has always been the tradition of the APC. We did that in 2015 and 2019 if you remember. The only difference is that we just decided to inaugurate them ahead of others this year.\n \n It is women and young people if you ask me. There is actually a directorate carved out for youths in the campaign council headed by the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello. He is the director of youth mobilisation across the country. So, it is not just all about women alone. The youths are also given priority. \n I don\u2019t know how many people you claimed made the allegation. But we can only say that you cannot compile the names of more than 2,000 people without one or two glitches. It happened at other parties too.\n But in the case of those people you said were added without their consent, it may just be a matter of misunderstanding. Some people may express strong support for the party privately but may not want their names out there in the public. But those recommending them may not know and just decide to include their names to surprise them, whereas, in reality, the people may not want it. This is how it works at times. These are the things that happen at times with a communication breakdown. But I am not saying that this is possibly what happened in this case.\n \n Of course, it is based on their membership in the party. Some of these people were recommended. All those people you see on the campaign list were not picked centrally; they were recommended at different levels of the party.\n \n I don\u2019t need to answer this. A clause stated that all former governors were part of the campaign team. So, there may be no need to mention their names one after the other. If you study the campaign list, you will see the particular line that addressed that issue. It was boldly written there. \n I have no information to give on that. I have not been mandated to speak about it.\n   I think Nigerians have seen enough of them. You saw how the PDP national chairman (Iyorchia Ayu) mounted the podium during their campaign, promising Nigerians heaven and earth. And this is a man who could not keep just one small promise in his own party. As far as we can see, the PDP people are not saying anything new in their campaign. All they keep saying are things we are tired of hearing. I don\u2019t think they have anything new to tell Nigerians who have seen the kind of treachery going on in the party. And these are the people we want to hand power over to again? Nigerians are wiser.\n \n No, I don\u2019t think so. Nigerians know them very well. We have seen all they can offer. There is no trick in the book that the PDP can pull out again for Nigerians. PDP is not attracting anybody again. They are just a conservative old party. I know they have lost a lot of supporters between 2019 and now largely to the \u201cObidient\u201d movement. Obi is seriously eating into their stronghold and they are very angry with him. In fact, we are encouraging Obi as a third force.\n What do you expect? He is an old war horse. This is about his sixth attempt, and he is no longer excited about it. And I think there is a sense of loss around him too. He understands the problem he is facing at home. About five governors have pulled out of his campaign. It was the same magic number in 2015. Remember the five governors\u2019 drama we had? Between 2019 and now, the PDP has lost ground. They have lost to Obi and Kwankwaso, a major factor in the South and another one in the North. What exactly do you think the APC has lost since 2019? We gained. The only place we lost was Edo State, which was replaced immediately by Cross River. It is a case of plus and minus. We gained the governor of Imo and won Ebonyi. We also gained Zamfara in the North-West. We are making up ground but the PDP lost massively. Apart from the major factors they lost in the north and south, they also lost followers.\n \n For the second time in Nigeria\u2019s history, we will see our brothers\u2019 fidelity and trustworthiness in the North. They have shown it in the case of MKO Abiola. Did you remember that Abiola defeated Tofa in Kano? Who were the forces that worked against him at that time? This same Asiwaju was a member of the then-SDP. They were the same people who worked for that Abiola ticket. Now, the second and most important thing I want you to know is that we have two major factors to put on the table. The first one is the commitment of the governors who control the North. We have 14 out of 19 governors if I\u2019m correct. The only ones we don\u2019t have control over are Taraba, Benue, Sokoto, Bauchi, and Adamawa. We have the commitment of our governors who said the ticket should be returned to the South. They took this decision at a time when they could have taken the ticket on a platter of gold. Their reaction was swift because they wanted to reunite the country.\n The second factor is the big masquerade \u2013 President Buhari \u2013 who will take Asiwaju\u2019s hand to say, \u201cThis is the anointed one.\u201d Does Buhari look like a dubious man? He is a soldier and campaign chairman for the APC. Those are the factors we are campaigning and banking on.\n \n Do you have any proof that there is one? The truth is that I cannot confirm or deny anything concerning our party and Wike. As a political party, in the generic sense of the word, our doors are always open for more people to come in. After all, politics is all about numbers.\n There is no clear statement, especially on the region we are using yet. We will determine the campaign kick-off and venue next week. I made this analogy somewhere that our party is like a 50-tonne trailer that you want to manoeuvre onto the highway. It is not the same thing as all these small cars that you will just kick and go. To manoeuvre a 50-tonne trailer onto the highway, you must warm the engine well to make sure the brake is effective. This is because if it gets onto the highway, it cannot be stopped because it is a big machine. That is how you liken it to the APC.\n This is the largest party with the most entrenched interests, far more than the PDP, because, of course, we are the ruling party and we have at the apex a sitting president, who also has different commitments and a presidential diary he must look at. The presidential diary, for those who know what it is, can be filled up from now till January. Seeing the president is not easy, let alone scheduling an appointment. And the fact that you want to schedule a hectic campaign activity into that diary is something else entirely. Aside from that, we have other interests from governors, stakeholders, the leadership of the party, NWC and all that. We are synchronising all of these to ensure that once the campaign takes off, it becomes seamless without rancour.\n \n Who is saying they are disunited? It is only by your (media) calculation. (Vice President Yemi) Osinbajo is like a very big brother to me. I have massive respect for him within the party. He may have lost the primary but that does not reduce any single strand of respect. I can tell you that.\n \n For now, he may not. I want you to take that as the gospel truth. The president himself said, \u2018Look, don\u2019t be part of the campaign council. Sit back and face governance for now.\u2019 That\u2019s what the president said.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/buhari-northern-govs-trustworthy-they-will-work-for-tinubu-keyamo/"},

Executive Order 21 is a hand grenade executive decree targeting to emasculate the opposition and stop the opposition from selling their manifestos to the people of Rivers State. Apart from this order restricting other political parties from making use of public facilities owned by the state government, proprietors of hotels and event centres have been forbidden from yielding their facilities for any sort of political meetings, including press conferences.\n This is the current state of democracy in an economically strategic state like Rivers. How can a state governor, who is a lawyer, make a pronouncement that is clearly on collision course with the Electoral Act? We advise that the Independent National Electoral Commission should go beyond issuing statements condemning the actions of governors, who attempt to intimidate their political opponents, but apply necessary sanctions as in the case of Rivers State. We are also of the opinion that the governor of our state should borrow a leaf from the Zamfara State governor, who has jettisoned the irrational Executive Order 10, which banned political activities in three local government areas of that state and shut down the operations of broadcast media houses in Zamfara State. \n As of yesterday (Wednesday), we had gone to notable event centres in Port Harcourt to get a facility for a proposed world press conference, but we were turned down on the orders of the governor. You may wish to make your independent investigation to confirm if such an order has been issued or not. This is the implication of keeping quiet, while pluralism and democratic ethos are dragged in the mud.\n You should first of all ask yourself whether INEC\u2019s approved spending limit is for the governorship and other strata of positions we are campaigning for. Are you aware that by virtue of Order 21, any political party attempting or wishing to pay this N5m before hosting just one rally will surely run afoul of the Electoral Act?\n \n The governorship candidate and other candidates are already meeting voters in different clusters, who we have always believed are kings and queens in this political season, all thanks to the BVAS technology. But in the coming days, our response will be abundantly clear.\n \n Those political parties you are referring to are an extension of the PDP. Do not be carried away by their public posturing because they have the sponsorship of the state government. In fact, you will soon see those on the PDP sponsorship list, posting bank payment tellers/approvals to hoodwink the unsuspecting public.\n   What are the facilities we are even talking about? Are the political parties going to campaign inside classrooms? How will campaigning in an open field lead to the destruction of facilities? In any case, if the law is in good conscience, why is the cautionary fee not refundable? This law is the crudest way of playing politics. \n We all know that the governor will never practice what he is preaching.\n \n Yes. It is a gambit to intimidate the opposition especially our party, the APC. Most of the other smaller parties are being sponsored by the governor.\n \n Application must come with the evidence of payment of the N5m per rally. Have you done the mathematics of what it will take for an Assembly candidate to campaign in his constituency? If we go by this N5m order, my candidate in my Omuma Local Government Area for example, would require N50m to campaign just for once in each of the 10 wards of that constituency. Whereas the ceiling for political campaign spending for the House of Assembly is N30m (Section 88 of the Electoral Act refers). Talking about INEC applying and getting approval, did INEC pay for such approvals? Please, nobody should listen to this INEC excuse. Is INEC a political party? Does the so-called Executive Order 21 affect INEC?\n Like I said earlier on, it\u2019s nothing but a hand grenade being introduced into the political process in the state, and it is quite unfortunate and exposes the undemocratic posture of the governor.\n \n If you do a fair analysis of our outings, you will agree with me that what I have been saying is that our political party is rooted in the 319 political wards of the state. Ours is a popular political party with a leader, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, who has garlands for excellent performance in public service.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "politics", "url": "https://punchng.com/wikes-order-21-aims-at-intimidating-opposition-nwauju/"},

The mother later had to struggle for the attention of her children. The film reminds us of the sacrifices our parents have made for us and that we should appreciate them.\u201d Stephen, who is notable for her films, \u2018Breaded Life\u2019, \u2018Finding Baami\u2019 and \u2018Picture Perfect\u2019, also said winning awards was not a priority for her, stating, \u201cI appreciate it when people hail me for my films.

I am more concerned about doing great work.\u201d Speaking on if she had ever thought about having a career in acting, she said, \u201cI try once in a while to feature in my films and in other people\u2019s films. I would love to act but there are a lot of other things that are on my hands.\u201d She also revealed that the ability to perform was the first thing she would consider before selecting a cast in her film. \u201cThe ability to perform is very important. Performance can only be obtained if the actor connects with what he is reading. In the case of \u2018Sista\u2019, four of us involved in the film were raised by a single mum. The second thing is the capability to perform the story.

I know when I finished school, I went to look for a job and the man said, \u2018I like you, let me sleep with you, and I will give you the job\u2019. It is everywhere. It is you as a person that should make your choice.\n \u201cThere isn\u2019t a gun placed on your head to accept by force. That thing for me is a fallacy; I just feel it is what you want to do that you will do.\u201d\n The actress noted that there was a growth process in the industry, but most people wanted to quickly become a star, adding that she followed the process. \u201cI went from one step to the other. Everything is a gradual process, but most of them want to be a star hastily. By that, they will be desperate, and once they are desperate, they will make a lot of mistakes,\u201d Okafor stated.  Speaking on the notion that most actresses don\u2019t know how to keep their marriages, she said, \u201cI totally disagree when people say actresses don\u2019t keep their homes; we have a lot of people that are divorced, but they are not actors and actresses. Everything an actor does is news.\n \u201cSome people don\u2019t want actors to have their privacy anymore. If an actress is in a home that she isn\u2019t comfortable with, I don\u2019t think she should stay there because once that actress is dead, that is her end.\u201d Okafor also spoke about how she copes with her male admirers, adding that she was not a rude person.

I don\u2019t get to be rude except if the person is rude to me, but if the person is nice to me, I will be nice.\n \u201cThere are limits to what I should do with a particular person.

Until that moment, many fans had doubted the reconciliation of the two music stars, especially after \u2018Koko master\u2019 dedicated the Lifetime Achievement Awards he won at the 2022 Headies Award on September 9 to Don Jazzy. It was assumed that Don Jazzy was reluctant to receive the award.\n This was not the first time that both of them were caught up in such a situation. On February 19, 2016, at Ben Murray-Bruce\u2019s birthday and book launch, where both of them were in attendance, D\u2019banj beckoned on Don Jazzy to join him on stage at the request of the host, who said he wished to see them perform one last time, but Don Jazzy was nowhere to be found.\n However, in a tweet, Don Jazzy later stated that as of the time D\u2019banj invited him to the stage, he was already out of the venue and did not ignore him like many people insinuated. The silent feud between them started in 2012 when the two music stars dissolved their joint record label, Mo\u2019Hits, as a result of differences in interest. According to the Corporate Affairs Commission, Mo\u2019Hits Records was founded in 2006, with D-banj signed as the co-owner. The label was responsible for many of the Koko master\u2019s hit albums.  Since their separation, several efforts by their loved ones and fans to bring the duo back together proved abortive until their performance together on December 27, 2017 at the Davido\u2019s 30 Billion Concert.\n Since then, the friendship of the duo has waxed stronger. In January 2022, D\u2019banj said Mo\u2019Hits reunion was slated to happen the previous year, but Don Jazzy postponed it. However, this has not stopped D\u2019banj from looking out for his friend. Before the burial ceremony of Don Jazzy\u2019s late mother, Mrs Indian Picolo, who passed away in July, D\u2019banj was present at his erstwhile partner\u2019s mansion to show support. In a video, Don Jazzy\u2019s father, Mr Collins Ajereh, had stated how D\u2019banj had been there for his son and the family in trying times.\n Don Jazzy and his father also shared a good time with D\u2019banj, Timaya and others, singing and laughing.

So, I thought about skit making since it\u2019s also a way for me to showcase my acting skills and I bless God for His mercy thus far.\n \u201cI got inspired to be an actress from my childhood. Growing up, I always watched soap operas and seeing the actors, who showcased their talents back then, inspired me. As I grew older, I joined the drama group in my church and this helped me to have an avenue to better develop and improve my acting skills. \u201cSubsequently, during my university days, I decided to take it to the next level and face this career path squarely.

I was interested in musicals and we didn\u2019t have a lot in Nigeria. So, I decided to get directors to do it. I had the vision but I didn\u2019t know I could direct, but essentially I found out in the cause of that production that I could direct because I was telling them (directors) what I wanted to achieve. Based on that, I decided to start directing my own shows.\n I think the public will be in a better position to tell whether it is doing well or not. However, I think that we have recorded a lot of successes. Our plays are probably the most watched plays in Nigeria today. \u2018Fela and the Kalakuta Queens\u2019 is probably one of the longest running plays in Nigeria today. It is being shown over a hundred times in different locations \u2013 South Africa, Dubai, Egypt, Lagos, Abuja.\n Our performances have the highest number of attendees at any point in time for a theatre performance in Nigeria. In addition to that, we have been able to influence and create a completely new subculture. People are doing musicals because we started doing musicals here at Terra Kulture. If you look at the landscape, ninety percent of those doing musicals in Nigeria today came out of Terra Kulture. I think that in itself is something remarkable.\n I think the biggest challenges are funding and scripting. Getting a good script and funding it is quite challenging. Even when one has a good script, one needs funding to do it as well as one will like. In Nigeria, we operate on almost 10 per cent or less of what a Hollywood budget will be for the same script, because they have the money to do it right.\n \n I think that if you look at music, it is almost like a solo act. It is one man and his craft. Music is easy to move around and easy to sell. Movies take a lot more collaboration and have different levels. One has to do the pre-production, production, post-production, and then look for partners and distributors. Everybody loves music and the brand of music that we have right now \u2013 Afrobeats \u2013 which is a fusion of so many things that has become so popular has cut across. Movies have their own peculiarity, so I think that it is probably easier to sell music than movies.\n \n I think that if you look at what is going on, there is growth, and things are getting better from where they started. I am not a veteran in this space. For those who started art, I am sure they can tell you better that there\u2019s been a lot of growth and for those of us who were consuming it as well and being an active participant also, I feel that even from four years ago, things have changed a lot. There are more international collaborations and awareness about Nigerian content. There are Nigerians abroad now who are consuming and helping to spread the work, and there are more distributors coming onboard as well. There is growth and it can only get better.\n \n (Laughs) I don\u2019t know, I guess maybe at that time, there was a tendency for us all to want to do the so-called professional courses. \n I am happy. These things happen because we have worked really hard, and we have grown a brand over the years based on consistency and excellence. We have grown a team as well. I have a phenomenal team of people that I work with including all my staff members and partners.\n \n I think Nigerians love the arts. The problem is that we are striving for socio-economic and political rights as a people in a way that enjoying and appreciating creativity is taken from everybody. People are struggling to get to work and get a life. Nigerians appreciate art. It is just that they don\u2019t have the luxury of time and finance to be able to partake in it.\n \n For me, I just don\u2019t want to be throwing out content. I like content that relates to our everyday life and how we live. I am a student of history and literature. A lot of times, there is a lot of satire. I love to comment on what is going on in our society using my art to tell the story. When I look at the project, I am asking myself what lessons will I be leaving with this story, and there is nothing wrong with those that don\u2019t have a message. It is just what I prefer. I prefer to have a message in my story. If you look at \u2018Bling Lagosians\u2019, it is about the fake lifestyles of people in Lagos. If you look at \u201893 Days\u2019, it is almost like a documentary of how Ebola disease came into Nigeria. These stories are there for posterity. We constantly ensure that the stories have a message they are telling.\n \u00a0Your movie, \u2018Man of God\u2019, talks about the ills in religious centres. Was the story borne out of personal experience? No, I think it was just me again looking around me and observing. I observe a lot. When I am in a room and I am watching the television, I am just thinking about why, how and what informs that behaviour. \u2018Man of God\u2019 was deeper than that, but I had to be very careful and had to be sensitive to the feelings of those who are really into those beliefs. These are stories that come to me simply by watching society.\n \n It depends; each movie has its own budget. Some movies are low-budget. Any movie can gulp as much as the director and the executive producers are able to fund it. You can fund a movie for N10m, N100m, $1m, or $10m. It depends on how deep the pockets of the executive producers are, and how big the vision of the director is as well.  \n None of us will want to go to a place where there is heavy banditry. Those are things that affect us as a business. It affects everybody because one cannot operate in a system where there is no security. For us at Terra Kulture, we are also impacted by what is going on in Nigeria. We are fortunate that Lagos is secured to an extent.\n \n I think that the online distribution platforms have given us options. Prior to now, there were no options for cinemas and the cinema owners would also sell them on your behalf. However, we now have these platforms that allow us to at least explore other possibilities, which means that when there is competition and there are options, the consumer or the seller of the products will benefit. Right now, these are better times and can still be better. It\u2019s been a positive trend. \n Oh yes, of course! Again, it is a question of the depredation in our society. People need to extract when they get an opportunity and I recognise that. One has to get a permit and work with the local communities. What we do is that there is always somebody who is just like the liaison person who talks to them. We just have to make sure that everybody is happy and they have to be on your side\n \n I agree. Like I said, there are different genres of movies. One can do a biopic. We just did one on Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti; that is us telling the story of a Nigerian hero and then, there are so many other people. I think one was done on Babangida.\n \n The most passionate one was Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti; I have done that and I am going to look for the next one; but there are so many stories to talk about.\n It feels great! (laughs)\n \n Being a lawyer is a full-time job, it is not possible (that I still practice as a lawyer).\n \n I am extremely disciplined and I believe that I am here to add value to my society and wherever it is that I find myself. Also, I have a sense of responsibility for the younger generation as well. We all need to pass on whatever it is that we have learned in the course of our lives.\n \n I have noticed that there are some downtimes. After my Easter play, I always find out that I can take off and have a good time till about September. \n Honestly, for me, I just do what makes me happy, and what makes me happy is my job and my family. If in the course of doing all of these I am passing on something to other people and I am also leaving a legacy, I will be very happy. But I do know that I have trained a lot of very young people; if that is my legacy,  \n \n I unwind at Terra Kulture and occasionally I go to the Book Club. Also, I travel a lot.\n \n I love to dress casual.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://punchng.com/nigerians-dont-have-time-to-enjoy-art-bolanle-austen-peters/"},

But the three of them had \u201cnot been able to work out a way of doing this\u201d, he added.\n \u201cTherefore I am afraid the best thing is that I do not allow my nomination to go forward and commit my support to whoever succeeds,\u201d he said in a statement.\n \u201cI believe I have much to offer but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time.\u201d Earlier Sunday, Sunak formally announced he was standing for the top job, just weeks after having failed in a first attempt.\n The former finance minister vowed \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability\u201d and to lead Britain out of \u201cprofound economic crisis\u201d.\n \u201cI want to fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country,\u201d he said in a short statement posted on Twitter confirming his widely expected candidacy.\n \n The Tories have been forced into a second, this time expedited, leadership contest since the summer following Truss\u2019s resignation after only 44 disastrous days into her tenure over her calamitous tax-slashing mini-budget.\n Johnson had cut short a Caribbean holiday to return to Britain Saturday to try to stage a political comeback less than two months after leaving office.\n He was reportedly lobbying Conservative colleagues ahead of a Monday afternoon deadline to secure the 100 nominations required to face a vote of the Tories\u2019 357 MPs. In his statement, he said he had met the threshold by gathering 102 nominations, after being \u201coverwhelmed by the number of people who suggested that I should once again contest the\u2026 leadership\u201d.\n There was \u201ca very good chance\u201d he could win the race \u2014 to be decided by the approximately 170,000 party members this week if a run-off is held.\n \u201cBut in the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do,\u201d he added.  \u201cYou can\u2019t govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.\u201d\n Johnson, who only relinquished power in early September following a government revolt over a slew of scandals, is still seen as the grassroots\u2019 favourite.\n Sunak had raced ahead in the count for Tory MPs\u2019 support, drawing backing from across the parliamentary party and crossing the minimum threshold Friday.\n He currently boasts the public backing of 146 Tory lawmakers, according to a BBC tally. The publicly declared support for Johnson ran at 57, and 23 for Mordaunt. \n Johnson and Sunak held talks late into Saturday night, reports said.\n The ex-leader also reportedly spoke on Sunday to Mordaunt, who was said to have rebuffed his calls to back him, noting her supporters were likely to split more for Sunak.\n Mordaunt, who missed out on the last contest\u2019s run-off by just eight MPs\u2019 votes, will now come under pressure to concede rather than force the contest to a vote of members.\n Before Johnson\u2019s announcement however, the 49-year-old had insisted she was \u201cin it to win\u201d.\n Johnson\u2019s attempt at political resurrection, while drawing significant cabinet and party backing, had also stirred opposition within his own party.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for Boris,\u201d Sunak-supporting Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker told Sky News, arguing another Johnson-led government \u201cwould be a guaranteed disaster\u201d and implode within months. New polling suggested the Tories could benefit from a change of leader, after Truss\u2019s missteps plunged them to unprecedented lows.\n But a survey by Conservative pollster James Johnson still found all three Tory candidates had negative favourability: Johnson on -24, Mordaunt -15 and Sunak -2.\n The main Labour opposition, which has opened up huge poll leads, is demanding a general election.\n \u201cThe country needs to get rid of this chaos,\u201d its leader Keir Starmer said.\n AFP", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://punchng.com/im-not-running-for-pms-post-boris-johnson/"},

He said, \u201cNot only have social protection programmes failed to meet the actual needs of PWDs, but these programmes have also failed to reach more vulnerable PWDs including children with disabilities, persons with multiple disabilities, persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, residing in rural communities and hard-to-reach areas, as well as girls and women with disabilities. \u201cAccordingly, the EDISOP project seeks to support Organisations of Persons with Disabilities towards developing sustainable leadership, institutional and advocacy capacities sensitive to social protection needs of marginalised PWDs, as well as the capacity to engage relevant agencies of government towards strengthening disability-inclusive social protection interventions.\u201d Fajemilo added that the foundation would work with the state government on sensitisation. \u201cThe target communities are Ibeju-Lekki and Badagry Local Government areas.

Take only those good sides of past administrations along with your plans to help your government and jettison the bad ones.\u201d\n Akinola spoke in Ado Ekiti on Friday at a prayer session organised by the pensioners \u201cto hand the new government in the state led by Oyebanji over to God for guidance and direction to succeed,\u201d saying such was part of the elderly people\u2019s way of assisting the new governor.\n He said, \u201cThis state needs to be rebuilt in the sense that many things have gone wrong. Ideally, this state should be a model for other states in the federation. Is it in terms of human resources or other natural resources? We are well endowed but unfortunately, we have had the problem of leadership that could effectively manage the resources for the development and excellence of the state. \u201cOur expectation of the new governor is to bring development and peace to this state, to help us in terms of security, especially for our pensioners. We want him to face our problems squarely. As pensioners, we need his impact urgently. He should attend to us immediately because we are hungry and dying.\n \u201cWe have humongous arrears of unpaid gratuities, about N40bn that past governments have refused to attend to. Local government pensioners were last paid gratuities in 2012, some of which are still outstanding, while state pensioners were last paid in 2013.\u201d\n According to Akinola, the government is owing local government pensioners seven months\u2019 arrears of pension while state pensioners are owed three months\u2019 arrears of pension. These, he said, were beside the non-adjustment of their pensions.\n He added. \u201cThe government owes us over six months of unpaid check-off dues, i.e., deductions from our pension. We were last paid in March.\n \u00a0\u201cIt will embarrass you that we have pensioners who are still receiving N4, 000 a month as pension in Ekiti, whereas the Nigerian Constitution stipulates that pensions should be reviewed every five years or any time the salary of workers is being reviewed. Pensioners in Ekiti are yet to witness the last minimum wage adjustment of 2019.\n \u201cAll these things are affecting our members in terms of welfare and feeding. An average pensioner has one illness or the other to manage, and we need money to access medical facilities and buy drugs. If you don\u2019t eat well, even if you have the drugs, how will they be effective?\n \u201cAt the close of the Fayemi administration on October 15, we had lost over 300 pensioners to death for his refusal to pay our gratuities and pensions. We have more than 400 bedridden because they cannot access medical facilities and, as well, lack money to properly take care of themselves. It is unfortunate.\u201d\n Akinola added, \u201cFormer Governor Kayode Fayemi began non-payment of gratuities to pensioners during his first tenure. His successor, Ayodele Fayose built on what he met on the ground, and Fayemi returned to consolidate it.

He added that the federal government would continue to provide support for investors.\n The governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the facility would boost the country\u2019s GDP and transform the state\u2019s economy, in addition to creating jobs for youths in the state. He added, \u201cThis facility will transform Lagos State, Nigeria and Africa. We are particularly happy because there will not be a case of congestion at Apapa because the project has pipeline delivery connections, and that trucks can load and go out through Epe instead of Apapa.\n \u201cI\u2019m told that this terminal has been designed to make possible the direct transfer of products from large vessels to the Conventional Buoy Mooring and the Single Point Mooring facility. What this means is that vessels can conveniently berth here and discharge their products effectively within the minimum turnaround time.\n \u201cThis facility will not only serve Nigeria, it has also been positioned to look at the opportunity of export on the West African corridor.\u201d  He noted that the state had begun the construction of phase one of an 18.7km road from Epe to Eleko junction.\n The Group Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, said the terminal would ease the delivery of petroleum products in the country.\n \u201cClearly what is happening here is a massive growth in Lagos, especially because Lagos is the largest consumer of petroleum products in the country. Whenever there is a crisis of petroleum products in the state, the NNPCL is also concerned.\n \u201cWithout mincing words, this is the largest exit point for petroleum products that we have today and it has clearly demonstrated capacity by easing delivery of petroleum products to many parts of the country and whenever we are in difficult situations. We will always remember that the exit point that will work for us in recent times is the Pinnacle facility.\u201d Kyari said the country would need more energy sources of energy supply given its growing population.\n Pinnacle\u2019s Chairman and Emir of Bichi, Alhaji Ado Bayero, congratulated the company for the project, adding that its location was strategic to the development of the Nigerian downstream sector and the economy in general.\n The Chief Executive Officer, Pinnacle Oil & Gas, Dr Peter Mbah, described the project as the most effective and efficient downstream facility with support from local financial institutions.\n He stated, \u201cOur storage tank is currently able to handle up to 300 million litres of PMS and again, the facility is designed to permit rapid discharge into trucks for evacuation at a rate of up to 20 million litres per day. In addition to these, the terminal is supported by the world class services of the Lekki Free Zone Development Company in areas of services like power supply and truck traffic management.\n \u201cAlso, the location enables easy access and ingress, allowing trucks from our terminal to service the rest of the country without any need to traverse the Lagos metropolis in the future.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://punchng.com/pinnacles-1bn-petroleum-terminal-will-transform-lagos-buhari/"},

He is now all but certain to sail through to a third term as the country\u2019s president, due to be formally announced during the government\u2019s annual legislative sessions in March.\n Sunday\u2019s developments cement him as the most powerful leader since Communist Party founder Mao Zedong.\n In a wide-ranging acceptance speech on Sunday, Xi made signature remarks celebrating China\u2019s rise as a global power and its success under his rule. \u201cThe world needs China,\u201d Xi said.\n \u201cAfter more than 40 years of unflagging efforts towards reform and opening up, we have created two miracles \u2014 rapid economic development and long-term social stability.\u201d\n Six of Xi\u2019s proteges and allies were also unveiled on Sunday alongside him as members of the Politburo Standing Committee \u2014 the party\u2019s apex of power that rules the country.\n Current Shanghai Party boss Li Qiang \u2014 who oversaw a gruelling two-month Covid-19 lockdown in the financial capital this year \u2014 was named as number two in the Standing Committee.\n This means he is likely to take over as premier from Li Keqiang, a former Xi rival who will retire next year.\n Close aide Ding Xuexiang, Guangdong Party chief Li Xi and Beijing Party boss Cai Qi were also in the re-jigged lineup.\n \u201cThe new Politburo Standing Committee confirms decisively that Xi has consolidated power at the top of the Communist Party to an extent unseen since the Mao era,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a senior China analyst at Eurasia Group. \u201cXi has installed allies onto all seven seats of the Communist Party\u2019s top decision-making body, allowing him to dominate the political system for the foreseeable future.\u201d  Alfred Wu Muluan, a Chinese politics expert at the National University of Singapore, said: \u201cIt is all Xi\u2019s people, signalling he wants to rule even beyond a third term.\u201d\n Xi abolished the presidential two-term limit in 2018, paving the way for him to govern indefinitely.\n Sunday\u2019s announcements came after a week-long Congress of 2,300 hand-picked party delegates during which they endorsed Xi\u2019s \u201ccore position\u201d in the leadership and approved a sweeping reshuffle that saw Li and other former Xi rivals relegated.\n On Saturday the delegates elected the Central Committee of around 200 senior party officials, who on Sunday chose the 24-person Politburo and the Standing Committee.\n The Politburo will have no women members for the first time in 25 years.\n Analysts had closely watched for whether the party charter would be amended during the Congress to enshrine \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d as a guiding philosophy, a move that would put Xi on a par with Mao. That did not take place, though a resolution did call the creed \u201cthe Marxism of contemporary China and of the 21st Century\u201d, adding that it \u201cembodies the best Chinese culture and ethos of this era\u201d.\n In the most dramatic moment of the Congress, Hu Jintao \u2014 Xi\u2019s predecessor as party leader and president \u2014 was forcibly led out of Saturday\u2019s closing ceremony.\n The frail-looking 79-year-old was reluctant to leave the front row, where he was sitting next to Xi.\n State media reported that Hu had been removed because he was feeling unwell, and that he had since recovered.\n But the extraordinary events, with Xi seemingly unfazed as Hu was lifted from his chair and escorted out, fuelled frenzied speculation among observers and analysts as to whether there were political factors at play.\n Xi has promoted a narrative in his first decade of power that he has rectified huge problems that beset China and the Communist Party during the reigns of Hu and his predecessors.\n These include graft within the party and unequal distribution of wealth. Adding to the intrigue, China\u2019s censors scrubbed references to Hu from the internet after he was removed from the Congress.\n One of Hu\u2019s proteges, Hu Chunhua, had been tipped by some to be named to the Standing Committee on Sunday. But Xi sidelined him. \nAFP", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://punchng.com/xi-jinping-secures-third-term-as-chinas-leader/"},

The Special Adviser to Governor Aminu Masari on Security Matters, Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed, told NAN that most of the hoodlums had envisaged a bleak future and were willing to make amends.\n According to him, the approach adopted by government targeted at \u2018building the courage\u2019 of the people, had started yielding positive results, with the rate of attacks by bandits reduced.\n Ahmed said success could be achieved easily through the combined efforts of the citizens, the state government and security agencies. He said the state government had trained 1,100 highly volunteers to serve as members of community vigilante corps, and were ready to make sacrifices for their communities to survive.\n According to the adviser, this is an effort to send a message to the bandits to embrace peace or face tough time.\n In Sokoto, a security expert, Sqdr. Leader Aminu Bala (retd.), observed that activities of bandits had reduced slightly in the past few months, but called for the sustenance of the current military onslaught on the hoodlums.\n Also, Laminu Umar, a resident of Sabon Birni in the state, noted that the situation in the area had changed for the better.\n \u201cThe ongoing military operation in our area has helped in checking the activities of the hoodlums.\n \u201cSome of the bandits have been neutralized, while others have fled because they cannot withstand the military power; the military operation should be sustained for a long time,\u201d he suggested.  Speaking to NAN, Bello Dantsoho, a resident of Rabah in Sokoto State, also observed some improvement. \u201cThey only storm remote areas, pick one or two persons and demand ransom before they release them.\n \u201cThey have been subdued to the extent that they can no longer launch deadly operations frequently, as was the case in the past.\n \u201cThis is unlike before when they attacked our people in numbers, killed, raped and stole belongings, including livestock,\u201d he said.\n Meanwhile, some religious leaders in Kaduna State have observed that insurgency had remained unabated in the state, but admitted that little success had been achieved.\n One of the leaders who is also the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria in the state, Rev John Hayab, said in spite of the little success recorded, the persistence of insurgency was worrisome.\n Hayab observed that the number of security agents tackling the challenge was enough but stressed that what was needed was building of the people\u2019s confidence that would encourage sharing of useful information.\n According to him, many people are still reluctant to \u2018say something\u2019 whenever they \u2018see something\u2019 around their environment. \u201cWhen you have the understanding and support of all stakeholders and the public, then you have your security beefed-up enough to unravel and tackle every security challenge.\n \u201cOnly then can you proudly say you are winning the war on insurgency,\u201d he said.\n In his contribution, the Acting Administrative Secretary of Jamaatul Nasril Islam, National Headquarters, Kaduna, Malam Yusuf Bida, said enhanced welfare package for security agents on the front-line, was key.\n He added that concerted media engagement efforts must also be intensified to dissuade citizens from serving as informants to hoodlums.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://punchng.com/banditry-self-defence-approach-yielding-results-northwest-residents/"},

Sunak, 42, is the second Conservative MP to declare a run at the top job, after cabinet member Penny Mordaunt launched her campaign on Friday.\n Johnson is anticipated to enter the likely week-long contest, after he cut short a Caribbean holiday to return to Britain Saturday and attempt an audacious political comeback less than two months after leaving office.\n The 58-year-old is said to be intensely lobbying Conservative colleagues ahead of a Monday afternoon deadline to secure the 100 nominations required to face a vote of 357 Tory MPs. Sunak has raced ahead in that count, crossing the minimum threshold Friday and currently boasting the public backing of 139 Tory lawmakers, according to a BBC tally.\n That compares to Johnson\u2019s 56 and 23 for Mordaunt, though the ex-leader\u2019s allies insist he has secured the 100 nominations.\n \u201cBoris\u2019s campaign tell me that they have the numbers,\u201d Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC. \u201cClearly, he is going to stand. There is a great deal of support for him.\u201d\n The Tories have been forced into a second, this time expedited, leadership contest since the summer following Truss\u2019s resignation after only 44 disastrous days into her tenure over her calamitous tax-slashing mini-budget.\n If two candidates remain after Conservative lawmakers vote Monday, the party\u2019s approximately 170,000 members will make their choice, with the result announced Friday.\n Johnson, who only relinquished power in early September following a government revolt over a slew of scandals, is still seen as the grassroots\u2019 favourite.\n Amid growing calls for unity within the fractured ruling party, he and Sunak held talks late into the night, reports said Sunday, as the feuding political heavyweights battle behind the scenes. Few details have emerged about what The Sun dubbed a \u201csecret summit\u201d. The Sunday Times said it lasted several hours \u201cin the hope of burying the hatchet and thrashing out a deal to govern together\u201d.  \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting for white smoke,\u201d an ally of one told the newspaper.\n However, Sunak\u2019s announcement Sunday suggests he is confident he can vanquish Johnson.\n Mordaunt, who missed out on the last contest\u2019s run-off by just eight MPs\u2019 votes, is adamant she alone is able to bring the party together.\n \u201cI\u2019m best placed to unite our party,\u201d the 49-year-old told the BBC, arguing she was \u201cthe halfway house\u201d between Sunak and Truss in the summer race.\n Johnson\u2019s attempt at political resurrection has already been decried by opposition politicians, and even some in his own party.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for Boris,\u201d Sunak-supporting Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker told Sky News, arguing another Johnson-led government \u201cwould be a guaranteed disaster\u201d and implode within months. \u201cVoters out there love him and he\u2019s a wonderful man \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t have that meticulous compliance with tedious rules,\u201d he added.\n Sunak has also picked up several other endorsements, including from Home Secretary Grant Shapps, a former ally of Johnson, and trade minister Kemi Badenoch, an influential right-winger who finished fourth in the last leadership contest.\n In a swipe at the ex-premier in The Sunday Times, she cautioned against \u201cnostalgia for the cavalier elan of 2019\u201d \u2014 when he won an 80-seat majority \u2014 and said the party \u201cis not a vehicle for any one individual\u2019s personal ambitions\u201d.\n New polling showed the Tories could benefit from a change of leader, after Truss\u2019s missteps plunged them to unprecedented lows.\n But a survey by Conservative pollster James Johnson still found all three Tory candidates had negative favourability, with Johnson on -24, Mordaunt -15 and Sunak -2.\n The main Labour opposition, which has opened up huge poll leads, is demanding a general election.\n \u201cThe country needs to get rid of this chaos,\u201d its leader Keir Starmer said.

{"headline": "FG subsidy spending to hit N11tn in 2023", "image_url": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11222033/Fuel-dispenser.jpg", "author": "Okechukwu Nnodim", "posted_date": "24th October 2022", "description": "The administration of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), could spend not less than N10.976tn as subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, from when it came to power in 2015 till May 2023.\n Already the government has spent about N6.88tn in subsidising the commodity, according to data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited and the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.\n The President and his party, the All Progressives Congress while campaigning in 2015, kicked against the fuel subsidy scheme that was implemented by the previous administration of the Peoples Democratic Party. NEITI\u00a0 stated in a report submitted last month to the House of Representatives ad hoc committee investigating the fuel subsidy regime from 2013 to 2022, that petrol was subsidised all through these years.\n \u00a0Figures from the report showed that fuel subsidy gulped N316.7bn in 2015; N99bn in 2016; N141.63bn in 2017; N722.3bn in 2018; N578.07bn in 2019; and N134bn in 2020.\n Although the NEITI report did not state the amount spent in 2021 and 2022, figures obtained from NNPC indicated that fuel subsidy jumped to N1.43tn in 2021. NNPC data also showed that petrol subsidy gulped N2.565tn between January and August this year. The oil company, however, described its subsidy spending as under-recovery.\n \u00a0NNPC said its under-recovery of PMS/value shortfall, otherwise called fuel subsidy, was N210.38bn, N219.78bn, N245.77bn and N271.59bn in January, February, March and April 2022 respectively.\n In the months of May, June and July, petrol subsidy gulped N327.07bn, N319.18bn and N448.78bn, respectively. In August this year, subsidy gulped N525.71bn. The total sum spent on PMS subsidy during the eight months was put at N2.565tn.\n The amount spent on subsidy in September 2022 has not been released yet by NNPC, as well as what the company could spend in the remaining three months in 2022.\n However, going by the global cost of crude oil and the volume of petrol consumed in Nigeria since January, which are the major factors that drive subsidy, the oil company might still spend over N200bn monthly on subsidy.\n The least amount that it spent on subsidy in the eight-month period so far captured in 2022 was N210.38bn. This implies that should crude oil prices continue to fluctuate between $90 and $100/barrel, the company\u2019s monthly subsidy spending would not go below N200bn.\n Hence, the company would spend not less than N800bn as a subsidy on petrol from September to December 2022. \u00a0In the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, the Federal Government proposed to spend N3.3tn on fuel subsidy between January and June 2023.\n \u00a0Early this month, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, told members of the House of Representatives that the Federal Government\u2019s projection was to spend N6.72tn on subsidy in 2023.\n She, however, said the second option of the government was to keep subsidy till June 2023 and that in this option, fuel subsidy was projected to gulp N3.3tn.\n A combination of all the above figures indicated that the Buhari regime could spend nothing less than N10.976tn on petrol subsidy from 2015 and June 2023.\n Oil marketers, economists, and global financial institutions, among others, are not comfortable with the persistent rise in Nigeria\u2019s fuel subsidy, amidst the country\u2019s high indebtedness and other economic challenges.\n They explained that the fuel subsidy cost over the last 2.5 years represented a lost opportunity to invest in key capital resources to raise the literacy, standard of living and security of the average Nigerian.\n \u201cNigeria\u2019s fuel subsidy programme has continued to limit remittances to the Federal Account Allocation Committee by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, for distribution to the Federal Government, states and Local Government Areas,\u201d the President, Petroleum Retail Outlet Owners Association of Nigeria, Billy Gillis-Harry told our correspondent. They also stated that civil service compensation and the national minimum wage remained a delicate topic, as the recent strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities underscored the need to address and lay to rest the civil service compensation and incentives conversation.\n The PUNCH, for instance, exclusively reported recently that the Nigerian Economic Summit Group raised concerns of an impending fiscal crisis in Nigeria following the continued rise in fuel subsidy.\n It disclosed this in its September 2022 report titled, \u201cThe State of Nigeria\u2019s Economy,\u201d stressing that the Federal Government\u2019s huge fuel subsidy spending had been a drain on the country\u2019s revenue despite the rise in crude oil prices in 2022.  The NESG said the government should cut its fiscal deficit to avert an impending fiscal crisis, highlighting the gradual withdrawal of fuel subsidy as one of the measures to achieve this.\n \u201cEmbark on the gradual phasing out of the fuel subsidy programme,\u201d the economic think-tank told the Federal Government, stressing that sustaining the programme was \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n \u00a0It added, \u201cAside from taking a clear position on the fuel subsidy issue, the Federal Government must begin the shutting down phase of subsidy programmes to save the country from impending fiscal crisis.\n \u201cUnderstandably, this suggestion will affect the welfare of the citizens but it is only in the short term. On the other hand, the more extended effects of sustaining this programme are disastrous.\u201d On his part, an Associate Editor of SPE Journal of Economics and Management, Prof. Wumi Iledare, in an interview with The PUNCH, said the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 had indirectly put an end to subsidy but wondered why the Federal Government had failed to obey the law.\n He said, \u201cThe midstream and downstream regulatory authority has no power in the PIA to set the price of petroleum. The power derives in setting the price of petroleum comes from the Petroleum Act of 1969, which in a way does not exist.\n \u201cSo, it is illegal to set petrol. Before now, NNPC can decide to do what they call under-recovery, however, the Fiscal Responsibility Act is another thing to contend with when you spend money on behalf of the government.\n \u201cBut currently, the NNPC Limited is a commercial company and it is meant to make money for investors. So, I don\u2019t see how the government will want the NNPC to sell petrol at a lower price and not recover it. That will be violating the NNPC Limited\u2019s responsibilities and functions in the PIA.\u201d\n He added, \u201cYou cannot run a government of illegality. Therefore, petrol subsidy in itself is a violation of the PIA. You cannot spend what is not budgeted in the budget. And when you are borrowing money and using it to fund subsidy, that is a misallocation of scarce resources.\n \u201cConsider the number of years that the universities have closed down. What are they asking for? Less than N1tn and you are spending over N3tn to subsidise petroleum products in the next budget.\n \u201cThat is even a violation of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which says that you cannot fund your budget more than three per cent of your Gross Domestic Product. All of these things have implications on the overall economy.\u201d The regime of the President had approved $2.9bn (N1.26tn at the official rate of N436/$) for the rehabilitation of Nigeria\u2019s dormant refineries.\n The NNPC in 2021 said it spent N100bn on refineries\u2019 rehabilitation. It did not name the refineries in its report that was submitted to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee.\n Between January and August this year, the oil company again said it spent N54.66bn on the rehabilitation of refineries. Again no refinery was mentioned by the oil firm.\n It was gathered that the $2.9bn approved for refineries\u2019 rehabilitation was being released in phases but the plan is to have the facilities fixed with this fund.\n In March 2021, the Federal Executive Council approved the plan by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources to rehabilitate the Port Harcourt Refinery with $1.5bn.\n The decision was taken at the weekly meeting of the council presided over by Buhari, this was disclosed to reporters by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva.\n The contract for the Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation was awarded to an Italian company, Tecnimont spa. Also, in August 2021, the Federal Government approved the sum of $1.4m for the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries in Delta and Kaduna states.\n A breakdown of the approved funds showed that $897m would be expended on the rehabilitation of the Warri refinery while $586m of the fund would be invested in the Kaduna refinery.\n It should be noted that the $2.9bn is basically for refineries\u2019 rehabilitation, as the facilities have been consuming billions of naira, if not trillions, on operating costs, salaries, maintenance and other expenses.\n The Federal Government has been making moves to get the country\u2019s dysfunctional refineries back on stream, as Nigeria currently imports the bulk of its refined petroleum products.\n This has resulted in humongous subsidy spending by the NNPC, the sole importer of petrol into Nigeria for more than four years and counting.\n The APC had during its campaigns in 2015 promised to get the refineries working. Buhari is billed to leave office in May 2023 and may have about seven months to fulfill the promise of getting Nigeria\u2019s refineries working.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "news", "url": "https://punchng.com/fg-subsidy-spending-to-hit-n11tn-in-2023/"},

Napoli can afford to make demands in negotiations with interested parties, as Osimhen\u2019s contract does not expire until 2025, but he is expected to be at the heart of a transfer tussle next year.  The likes of Manchester United and Chelsea are believed to be interested in a deal for the 23-year-old, while Arsenal were also linked before striking a deal for Gabriel Jesus.\n Now,   claims that Tottenham are also plotting a move for Osimhen, who has been recommended to Fabio Paratici by Antonio Conte. The report claims that Conte is set to be working with a budget of \u20ac200m (\u00a3174.4m), but a move for Osimhen could eat into at least half of that war chest.\n As a result, the Nigerian is supposedly earmarked as a secondary option for the Lilywhites, who are reluctant to spend more than \u20ac100m (\u00a387.2m) on one player.\n Bayern Munich are also said to be keeping tabs on Osimhen, who is more interested in a club\u2019s sporting project and his prospects of getting regular starts rather than a lucrative paycheck.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/spurs-join-race-for-osimhen/"},

Roma are seven points back in fifth after a dogged, battling performance at the Stadio Olimpico which lacked in invention and but largely kept a lid on possibly Europe\u2019s most exciting team.\n Napoli thought they had a chance to open the scoring from the penalty spot when referee Massimiliano Irrati blew for a foul on Tanguy Ndombele by Roma goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\n But as a chorus of boos and whistles rolled down the stands from fans outraged at penalising Patricio when he clearly took the ball first, Irrati checked the pitchside monitor and overturned his own decision. Roma didn\u2019t have a single shot on target in the first half and struggled to create anything after the break, when Napoli slowly began to threaten.\n Eljif Elmas was denied a close-range tap-in on the hour mark by a magnificent Chris Smalling block and from the resulting corner ex-Roma man Juan Jesus slashed wide after being set up perfectly by Osimhen.\n Osimhen dragged a colossal chance wide with just Patricio to beat after a lightning Napoli counter-attack in the 70th minute.\n But the 23-year-old rattled in a much more difficult effort 10 minutes later, charging on to Matteo Politano\u2019s booted long pass before holding off Smalling and claiming the three points with a rocket of a finish.  \n Atalanta had the chance to move a point in front of Napoli ahead of their win at Roma but Lazio put in the perfect away performance without injured Italy striker Ciro Immobile to move into the top four.\n Mattia Zaccagni\u2019s tap-in at the end of a beautifully-worked team move put Lazio ahead in the 10th minute at the Gewiss Stadium. And Felipe Anderson, replacing Immobile in a false nine forward role, ensured Lazio would leapfrog Atalanta into third place when he drilled in the away side\u2019s second eight minutes after the break following a burst down the left from Adam Marusic.\n Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side are level on 24 points with Atalanta, who sit fourth, after winning five of their last six league matches during which time they haven\u2019t conceded a single goal.\n \u201cThis year we play every match like a team that fights for every ball and you can see that in the results,\u201d Anderson told DAZN.\n Atalanta barely created a chance, a far cry from the thrilling teams Gian Piero Gasperini has created in Bergamo in recent seasons.\n They will be without key forward Luis Muriel at Empoli next weekend as the Colombian was sent off late on for two bookable offences.\n Udinese\u2019s fairytale start to the season hit another bump in the road as Torino ran out surprise 2-1 winner at the Dacia Arena.\n Andrea Sottil\u2019s team were in sight of the Serie A summit two weeks ago but two draws and Sunday\u2019s loss to ninth-placed Torino leave them sixth, eight points off the pace.

{"headline": "Barcelona thrash Athletic Bilbao 4-0", "image_url": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/14070628/Ousmane-Dembele-.jpg", "author": "Agency Report", "posted_date": "23rd October 2022", "description": "Ousmane Dembele scored and laid on a hat-trick of assists as Barcelona ripped apart Athletic Bilbao in a 4-0 win in La Liga on Sunday, to stay three points behind leaders Real Madrid.\n The French winger was at his thrilling best after being brought back into the side and challenged to make a difference by his coach Xavi Hernandez, ruining former Barca manager Ernesto Valverde\u2019s return to Camp Nou.\n Dembele netted the opener and then created goals for Sergi Roberto and Robert Lewandowski in the first half as Barcelona danced around Athletic.\n Ferran Torres fired home in the second half after Dembele found him in the area to complete the drubbing. It was Valverde\u2019s first game facing Barcelona since being sacked in January 2020 after winning two league titles, with the team top of the table in his third campaign when he was ousted.\n The visitors had started the season well after Valverde\u2019s summer appointment and seemed capable of offering the Catalans a stern challenge.\n But just as three goals in an eight-minute spell helped Barcelona vanquish Villarreal on Thursday, another treble inside 11 first-half minutes killed off Athletic. Xavi selected Pedri to operate on the left of the attack in his 4-3-3 formation, as Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta did on occasion \u2013- giving further credence to the already frequent comparisons between the two.\n It increased the team\u2019s fluidity, as did a double pivot of Sergio Busquets and Frenkie de Jong, although the star dust was added by Dembele.\n \n The French winger took the game by the scruff of the neck in the opening stages and it was no surprise when he broke the deadlock in the 12th minute.\n Dembele\u2019s long-range strike was parried by Unai Simon, but Barcelona kept the move alive and Lewandowski whipped in a cross for him to head home.\n Barcelona doubled their lead six minutes later, when Roberto played a one-two with Dembele, receiving the Frenchman\u2019s perfectly weighed pass and firing a deflected effort past Simon.\n The third followed with Dembele involved again, feeding Lewandowski, who turned exquisitely in the area and slammed home. It was his 12th of the season in La Liga in 11 appearances, the division\u2019s runaway top scorer. Despite Barcelona\u2019s impending Champions League elimination and Clasico defeat, the supporters remain behind Xavi, chanting his name when he protested about Dani Garcia brutally colliding with Gavi.\n The 18-year-old midfielder tried to play on but went down again a few minutes later and had to be replaced.\n Barca substitutes Ansu Fati and Torres both came close soon after being introduced, although the hosts were happy holding on to their comfortable advantage.\n Eventually Torres did strike, teed up by Dembele, who was afforded an ovation from supporters as he was replaced by La Liga debutant Pablo Torre.\n A double goal-line clearance by Busquets and then Eric Garcia denied Athletic a late consolation.\n Earlier Antoine Griezmann hit a brace, including one goal direct from a corner, to earn Atletico Madrid a 2-1 win at Real Betis.\n Nabil Fekir pulled a goal back for Betis in the 84th minute with a sublime free-kick, creating a tense finale but Diego Simeone\u2019s side held out for the three points, moving third. Griezmann, in excellent form since making his loan move from Barcelona to Atletico permanent, broke the deadlock in the 54th minute in spectacular fashion.\n The French forward whipped a corner in, narrowly over Saul\u2019s head, with the ball dipping in at the far post.\n \u201cI wanted to put (the corner) in with a tight angle, hard, and in the end there was a bit of luck too,\u201d Griezmann told Movistar.\n \u201cI told the referee I had never scored a goal from a corner, I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n Griezmann now has 147 goals for the club and is only 25 short of matching Luis Aragones\u2019s all-time club record.\n Elsewhere Villarreal winger Alex Baena was sent off for lifting his shirt to reveal a tribute message to late club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza during a 2-1 win over Almeria.", "newspaper_name": "Punch Newspaper", "category": "sports", "url": "https://punchng.com/barcelona-thrash-athletic-bilbao-4-0/"}
