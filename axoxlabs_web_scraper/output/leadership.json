The 18-year-old Crystal Palace player, who rose from the club\u2019s academy, has been described as nothing but a reliable goalkeeper for the Paddy McCarthy\u2019s Under-18 Crystal Palace side. Goodman\u2019s performances have seen him graduated from the academy to feature for the club\u2019s main team in the current 2022/23 season. Owen Olamidayo Goodman is a man spoilt with choice when it comes to his international football career. The goalkeeper was born in Canada to a Nigerian mother and British father. This means he can represent Canada, Nigeria and England for his international career. The young goalkeeper with a clear head and directions opened up on how he\u2019ll arrive at a decision. \u201cWhoever calls me first, I will honour the invite,\u201d Goodman said. When pushed further on the possibility of Nigeria, Owen gave an emphatic answer. \u201cI will be glad to play for my country (Nigeria) if I get the opportunity I will grab it,\u201d he said. Goodman made 19 league appearances for the Under-18s during the 2021/22 campaign, keeping six clean sheets. An athletic, imposing goalkeeper raised in Canada, Goodman has stepped up to the top Academy level between the ticks and even competed with the first-team in summer 2022\u2019s pre-season. Internationally, he has been recognised by England Under-18s. Goodman made 19 league appearances for the Under-18s during the 2021/22 campaign, keeping six clean sheets as Rob Quinn\u2019s side finished third in the U18 Premier League South. The following campaign he began to train regularly with the first-team and featured in the pre-season sides against Gillingham and Ipswich Town. His performances early on in 2022/23 earned him a place on the first-team bench against Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 2022. With the Super Eagles challenge in the goalkeeping department, Goodman may turn out to be the solution considering his age.", "newspaper_name": "Leadership Newspaper", "category": "education", "url": "https://leadership.ng/18-yr-old-uk-based-prodigy-goodmand-may-end-nigerias-goalkeeping-nightmare/"},

Bello Mohammed Matawalle is all out to crush opposition and dissenting views and anyone that he sees as a threat in the quest for the realization of his second term ambition. Well-meaning patriots who are non-political actors have neither been spared and are among the most affected victims of Matawalle\u2019s war without reason. We are well aware how the Chief Security Officer to the Zamfara State Governor, CSP Ibrahim N. Angbasa has abandoned his primary responsibilities and has now turned himself around to serve as the neutralizer of any threats against the Governor\u2019s second term ambition. This include arbitrary prosecution of opposition elements on phantom charges, arrest of social critics and threats to the freedom, safety and even life of anyone who opposes the return of the Governor. These practices are akin to dictatorship as witnessed under the military regimes. Howbeit, Matawalle has morphed into a rare breed of a democratic dictator and tyrant fused in one. It is public knowledge that the Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Matawalle has been dragged before the Federal High Court Gusau Zamfara State on account of a false affidavit sworn by the Governor as it relates to Constitutional requirements of eligibility and in contravention of Electoral Act as amended 2022 by one Muazu Mannir Haidara and Incorporated Trustee of Majalisar Matasan Arewa Association. Since the filling of the said suit, the Governor has become restless and irritant and has ordered the Chief Security Officer to track and deal with any threats against this Governor. This led to the illegal co-opting of the IGP Special Tactical Squad (STS) to champion the arrest and disappearance of those perceived to be stumbling block to the governor\u2019s elusive second term ambition. In the realization of the said ungodly mission, the IGP STS has arrested Bashir Dahiru Umar the Head of ICT at the National Examination Council (NECO), Headquarters, Minna, Niger State, for his refusal to delete the 2018 Governor\u2019s academic record from the NECO server, up to this day he remains captive at the Police Barracks, Constitution Road, Kaduna where he is being detained illegally. It is a documented fact that the Governor through his Chief Security Officer have arrested several opposition elements and summarily sent to prison using willing judges in the State Magistrate and High Courts and some have disappeared without trace. As we speak, one of the Governor\u2019s critic and a Member of the PDP in Zamfara State who goes by the name Mugira Yusuf is been trailed and to be tracked down by the CSO and brought to Zamfara State dead or alive simply for having a dissenting view against the Governor. We call on the IGP to redeploy the CSO to Zamfara State Governor CSP Ibrahim N. Angbasa for becoming politically partisan and a threat to democratic tenets and freedom of speech. As we continue to monitor the activities of CP Kolo. In the same vein, the IGP must order for the immediate release of NECO Head of ICT who is being detained illegally on the instruction of the Governor. We shall also monitor continuously if anything should happen to the NECO Head of ICT and the records of the Governor at NECO. Equally, we call for the transfer of the case regarding the false affidavit to Federal High Court Abuja to guarantee the safety of plaintiffs and counsels. As a coalition of balanced Civil Society Groups who are deeply concerned about good governance and safeguarding our thriving democracy, it is our bounden duty to consistently frown at tyranny and fervidly fight against any threat to freedom of our citizenry. We therefore use this medium to call on the Governor to honorably resign from Office while we allow for justice to be speedily dispensed with. Furthermore, judging from the incoherent academic records of Governor Matawalle we call on the All Progressives Congress to deploy the internal mechanism of the Party and expel him from their fold in order not to associate the APC with the tyranny and illegality the governor is carrying on. On the heels of the foregoing, we are using this medium to call on the UN, Amnesty International, NDI, US, UK to beam their searchlight on the ongoing undemocratic conduct and tyranny in Zamfara State as a way of safeguarding democracy and free choices. We trust that all true patriots and defenders of democracy will rise in opposition to these fiendish activities of Governor Matawalle. *  \n", "newspaper_name": "Leadership Newspaper", "category": "education", "url": "https://leadership.ng/certificate-forgery-zamfara-governor-matawalle-embarks-on-unlawful-use-of-state-apparatus-to-silence-critics/"},

The move according to the founder and president of RSDF, Barrister Paul Edeh, is to enable the organisers to celebrate more women who have continued to leave indelible mark in the anal of the society. Briefing newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday ahead of the tournament, Edeh said, aside the name of the tournament that is rechristened, it is still the same and one tournament. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall that in the past four years starting from 2019, we have consistently organised a pre-season tournament for women teams across Africa to prepare them for the football season, this year is not an exception. \u201cFor the past two seasons we have been holding the tournament under the aegis of Flying Officers Cup, but today, I\u2019m here to announce that we are deviating from that part. Henceforth, the pre-season tournament is no longer to be known as the Flying Officers Cup, but rather to be known as Shero\u2019s Cup. Fundamentally, it is one and the same tournament, but just that the name is rechristened. \u201cThe reason for the name change is principally to give us an opportunity to be able to celebrate more women who have achieved no mean feats in their respective endeavours. \u201cOver the years and centuries, women have continued to leave indelible mark in the anal of our society and we feel that such women should be celebrated and celebrated well. That is why moving forward the name and permanent name for the pre-season tournament shall now be Shero\u2019s Cup,\u201d Edeh said. Barr. Edeh who is also proprietor of the Nigeria Women Premier League (NWPL) side, Naija Ratels, this year Shero\u2019s will hold in two different back-to-back tournaments with the Premiership clubs slug it out in the first one while the Championship, Nationwide League and other amateur teams will battle for honours in the second tournament. \u201cIn the past we have held the preseason tournament in combined form for both teams from the Premiership, Championship and Amateur teams coming together to play in one tournament. But for this year, we decided to do something different. We are going to hold two different tournaments back-to-back. One will be dedicated principally to Premiership teams while the second is for the Championship and Nationwide League teams or even other amateur teams that are interested. \u201cAnother interesting thing about this year\u2019s pre-tournament, the winner of the 2022 Shero\u2019s Cup that will be holding from November 3rd to 13th, will represent Nigeria at the African playoff to determine Africa\u2019s representative for the Women Cup coming in the USA next year. Women Cup is an intercontinental tournament and this year\u2019s edition had six continents represented. The next year\u2019s event that is billed to hold in August, there will be a representative from the African continent that has never participated in the tournament. \u201cAlso, all participating teams of the Shero\u2019s Cup are winners from day one because the sum of N500 ,000 would be given to them each as subsidy and not the usual winner takes it all style.\u201d", "newspaper_name": "Leadership Newspaper", "category": "education", "url": "https://leadership.ng/flying-officers-cup-renamed-sheros-cup/"},

Not only that, the chairman must step down based on the various allegations that have been levelled against him. \u201cNo serious political party will go into a general elections with a national chairman with allegations of graft around his neck. \u201cIn case he does not know, Ayu-led PDP\u2019s threat to suspend Wike is like a case of a squatter attempting to evict the landlord. In this case, Ayu is the squatter will Wike is the landord. \u201cIf indeed he loves the party and wants it to win the forthcoming elections, Ayu should not remain as the party\u2019s national chairman for an additional one day.

It was the 16th time university teachers would be striking in 23 years. Frustrated parents and distraught students just couldn\u2019t wait to hear that the strike had been suspended and schools reopened. It does appear, however, that if all we\u2019re interested in is to tick the box, it won\u2019t be long before we\u2019re back to square one. There is a clear and present danger that we\u2019re kicking the can, with the teachers, down the road. And this bad sign, which was always there even while teachers were being bullied to return to class, was full blown on the first day of return. This may sound like Greek, but Good Samaritan and House Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, understands what I\u2019m talking about. He was among the last ranking public-spirited individuals to intervene to end the strike. Parties familiar with the dispute told me on Monday that up till then, the two sticking points were 1) an acceptable IPPIS, the integrated payroll system which manages university teachers\u2019 pay and allowances and 2) the no-work-no-pay rule which, according to the law, meant potentially that the teachers would not be paid for the eight months they were on strike. The Speaker assured them, however, that there would be \u201ca political solution\u201d, meaning that he had secured the understanding of the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to 1) allow a more flexible and competitive payroll system which, for example, would capture all allowances and accommodate payments by host schools during sabbaticals and 2) pay them in two tranches for the period of the strike. In case the Speaker is still available, however, he might be interested to know that the ASUU-FG fire hasn\u2019t been extinguished quite yet. The understanding collapsed even before the teachers reached the classrooms on Monday. On Day One of resumption at the University of Lagos teachers there and elsewhere told me they had been informed there was no going back on the full implementation of the vexatious payroll system and also that the no-work-no-pay rule still stands. In order words, while we felt a sense of relief, teachers returned to the classroom to confront the same fundamental problem that has dogged the agreement in the last two decades: bad faith. Teachers are, once again, left with the short end of the stick. Some would say deservedly. Half way through the strike voices of dissent were raising doubts about the usefulness of strikes and questioning how much effort the union itself was making to improve university funding. Why indulge the insanity of frequent strikes when everyone knows that this government treats serious issues as a sport? At its wit\u2019s end, ASUU yielded to being kicked down the road with the can. At which point triumphant government officials were only too pleased to bury the hatchet right in the wounded back of the union. It\u2019s no use going over the long list of the union\u2019s grievances, which has often been summarised as poor funding for education. It might, however, be useful to see how the pay-slip of an associate professor, who has spent nearly 20 years in a first-rank federal university, tells the story. This professor earns N436,545 monthly. Of this amount, total deductions \u2013 including payments for NHF for which no forms were completed, and inexplicable sundry taxes \u2013 account for 205k. The professor\u2019s net monthly salary is about 232k; that is, roughly N8,000 daily for teaching, research and community service! We can argue that in a country of generally low wages and poor productivity, misery is inevitably widespread. Yet, I think most might agree that if we want a truly great, secure and prosperous future, it is futile to pay peanuts and not expect monkeys in our classrooms. The question, however, is how do we deliver more value to the system. As long as course content and research are largely irrelevant to the needs of industry and society and delivery and feedback methods are even more irrelevant, schools will continue to find it difficult to attract donor funds, grants and endowments, which are the mainstay of universities elsewhere. Teachers will neither earn more respect nor money by behaving like shopfloor workers or comparing themselves with politicians sworn to a lifestyle of crookedness. The outrageous allowances that politicians in the National Assembly currently earn are proceeds of extortion. They are not a reflection of value and are therefore unsustainable. Schools will only get better by prioritising curriculum and research that focus on problem-solving. They must also encourage the academic culture of merit, curiosity and debate. Unfortunately, a number of academics have lost their way. Not a few are worse than the superstitious herd in our mushrooming faith centres. To fix the system students have to pay more. A statement by the Lagos State Commissioner for Education, Folashade Adefisayo, in September that the ratio of public to private schools in Lagos was 1:22 could be an indication that residents in the state, for example, may be willing to pay more for university education. The average tuition fees in the more stable private universities are more than twice those in state universities, especially in Southern states. And yet, in the more-in-demand federal universities, a student studying Economics, for example, will pay about N45,000 per session, while his counterpart studying the same course in a state university pays roughly 150 percent more! It also doesn\u2019t make sense that teachers in state universities paid by state governments would join teachers at the federal level to strike when they have no pay dispute with the state. This nonsense of state teachers taking Panadol for the headache of federal teachers must stop. Long established systems are politically difficult to dismantle, but like has been the case with state policing, it won\u2019t be long before economic circumstances teach us a lesson. The 43 federal universities should be dismantled, perhaps leaving only two per zone, with one in each zone focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The remaining 31 can be taken up either by state governments that wish to do so, or they are organised into autonomous units. Of course, not all of them will survive. A system of sponsorships, scholarships and loans should be reestablished. The reason for proposing two universities instead of one is that if only one university is established the system will gradually and eventually crowd out STEM, because our people seem to have difficulty coping with the rigour of science. It\u2019s true that useless Federal bureaucracies \u2013 TETFUND, PTDF \u2013 are fattening themselves at the expense of the entire system. Yet, we have seen from the way the universities manage funds even from their own internal programmes, that unless the system becomes more competitive, intentional, transparent and accountable, funds or grants, even if they come, would be wasted. According to a Central Bank report in May, Nigerians paid about $11.6 billion as fees in foreign universities in the last three years, including schools in countries whose citizens used to come here for higher education. It\u2019s not enough to wring our hands in lament. Already, the seed for the next strike has been sown by the government\u2019s malicious compliance with its own agreement from the first day \u2013 a trend that we have seen in the last over two decades. Perhaps the only thing that will save us from this famished road sooner than later is for teachers, parents, students and the government to admit that the system is broken. It will cost everyone something more than just kicking the can down the road to fix it.", "newspaper_name": "Leadership Newspaper", "category": "education", "url": "https://leadership.ng/a-professors-payslip-and-lessons-from-asuu-strike/"},

The Committee conducted a sale process by \u2018private treaty\u2019, as provided in section 34(5) of the AMCON Act to avoid negative speculations, retain value and preserve financial system stability. \u00a0 \u201cIn the process, parties who had formally expressed an interest in acquiring Polaris Bank, subsequent to the CBN intervention in 2018, were invited to submit financial and technical proposals. Invitations to submit proposals were sent to 25 pre-qualified interested parties, out of which three parties eventually submitted final purchase proposals following technical evaluation. \u00a0 \u201cAll submissions were subject to a rigorous transaction process from which SCIL emerged as the preferred bidder having presented the most comprehensive technical/financial purchase proposal as well as the highest rated growth plans for Polaris Bank,\u201d the statement added. \u00a0 Meanwhile, the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, was quoted as saying that the sale of the bank \u201cmarks the completion of a landmark intervention in a strategic institution in the Nigerian banking sector by the CBN and AMCON.\u201d \u00a0 He commended the outgoing board and management for their vital role since the bridge bank was established; in stabilising the Bank\u2019s operations, its balance sheet and implementing strong governance structures to address the issues that led to the intervention. \u00a0 According to the Governor, the process has provided the CBN with an unprecedented opportunity to recover its intervention funds in full and promote financial stability and inclusive growth. He wished SCIL well as they implement growth plans to build the bank from the strong foundations that have been established.\u201d \u00a0 It will be recalled that Polaris has been operating as a bridge bank since 2018 when the Central Bank of Nigeria intervened to revoke the licence of the former Skye Bank Plc and established Polaris Bank to assume its assets and certain liabilities. \u00a0 As part of the CBN intervention, consideration bonds with a face value of N898 billion (future value of N1.305 trillion) was injected into the bridge bank through AMCON, to be repaid over a 25-year period. The Bank noted that the actions were taken to prevent the imminent collapse of the bank, enable its stabilisation and recovery, protect depositors\u2019 fund, prevent job losses and preserve systemic financial stability. \u00a0 Speaking on the acquisition on Wednesday, October 19, 2022, the chairman of the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee investigating the sale of Polaris Bank, Hon.
